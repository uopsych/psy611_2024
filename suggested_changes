general lab feedback
* restructure first 3 labs to be "incomplete markdown format"***
* make the first minihack easy and walk them through it
* find out what was in the bootcamp and you can skim or gloss that content
* exercises throughout are good
* try to budget at least 20 minutes for mini-hacks
* add in-text R code (reporting sample sizes, means, proper formatting, etc)
* add recaps at the beginning of lectures
* talk about folder organization
* import data files from GitHub for "lecture" part of lab; have students load in different data file for minihacks using working directory
* first few weeks of term filled with "stupid" problems (need to reinstall packages; load library in Rmd, etc) -- let students know we expect this and we're not designing class to avoid those. better to practice dealing with them now

TA expectations
* prep labs (minor tweaks), attend lecture, take quizzes and homework assignments (to give feedback on difficulty and time)


homework general
* B's get degrees 
* don't say "it's in your best interest to attempt all of them"


13-open_science.html
* good focus on stats not broad
* get a real explaination for publication bias
* another slide is cut off here
* arxiv, bioarxiv
* more practical advice (like at the end)
* good to be realistic (obstacles, slow science)


2-homework.html

15-two-means_I.html (now 16)
* reiterate signal/noise
* add power

lab-8.html
* include welch's t-test
* good to have them walk through the steps
* had time to go through the mini-hacks
* add power

17-independent-sample.html
* make figures consistent with each other
* spell frequentist correctly

18-effect-sizes.html
* turn off scientific notation
* fix alterantive hypothesis for Levene's test
* pay attention to notation for standard deviation and standard error

  
CHANGES ALREADY ADDRESSED

schedule
* order should be one-sample t-test, paired sample t-tests, independent-samples t, effect sizes (cohen's d and overlap), assumptions and non-parametric tests


1-homework.Rmd
* rewrite correlation freedom/generosity instructions: "calculate the correlation between freedom and generosity" (take out thing about "for a country")
* 5.3 change validity of correlation to "statistical conclusion valdity"


12-critiques.html
* fewer quotes at the beginning (be prepared to run out of time) -- have extra day so leaving this in for now?

1-intro.html
* turn off notifications!

2-measurement.html
* Take out C&M? Replace with something else? Remove entirely? It's very dense, and maybe just too much. 

14-one_sample.html
* explain ()
* critical value dashed, test statistic solid lines

15-one_sample.html
* can be quick check 
* use one chi-square example throughout (don't switch back to lecture 14 example)
* change quiz 6 item to be about population mean, not sample mean
* add section here about shift in confidence intervals (95% CI around null mean, 95% around sample mean)

lab-7.html
* great work with Markdown
* maybe move up to week 3 (if moving matrix algebra moved to end of term)?
* on the other hand, nice to have a break from the challenging stuff mid-term
