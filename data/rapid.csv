23435,R3ID00020,2021-06-11T08:15:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not planning on it right now but i am open to the future
23436,R3ID00032,2021-06-09T10:59:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it is safe yet or ready.
23437,R3ID00032,2021-11-10T09:57:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure about the vaccine and it?s effectiveness. I?m still weary and haven?t decided on taking the vaccine yet
23439,R3ID00036,2021-09-15T21:11:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don?t feel like it works, I had to get it for work"
23440,R3ID00046,2021-06-09T09:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got both doses
23444,R3ID00049,2021-09-15T09:06:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
23445,R3ID00049,2021-12-10T08:17:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I think it's safe. Waited for my third shot so I can have more antibodies
23451,R3ID00083,2021-11-14T09:11:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am nervous about the vaccine and it?s potential long term side effects. I have gotten the vaccine.
23454,R3ID00084,2021-06-11T10:58:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust science and chose to get vaccinated.
23455,R3ID00084,2021-10-13T09:21:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the vaccine and I?m confident in the science behind it.
23460,R3ID00107,2021-03-17T21:09:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m pregnant so I will wait till I give birth to get it if possible.
23464,R3ID00117,2021-12-08T10:30:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already been vaccinated but still need to get my booster. I?ve had no concerns about safety
23471,R3ID00166,2021-03-17T22:15:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I prefer to wait 2-5 years to see the first round of long-term effects before finalizing my decision.
23473,R3ID00168,2021-12-08T10:13:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it?s effective even though I have it
23478,R3ID00184,2021-03-18T14:36:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it.
23481,R3ID00188,2021-07-07T10:57:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Family not getting it
23486,R3ID00188,2021-10-14T09:17:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not safe, never getting it"
23488,R3ID00188,2021-11-10T10:08:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not getting it. COVID is suppose to something new so the first rounds of shots/vaccines are just being ""tested"" on people. Also, I watched the news of people dying because of side effects due to the vaccine, so I don't trust it. I'm not anyones test dummy."
23489,R3ID00188,2021-12-10T09:10:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m not getting it, personally feel it?s for test dummies. Also feel that they don?t really know how to work because they are paying people to get it"
23494,R3ID00232,2021-03-17T22:11:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I am getting my vaccine this week. I am hopeful for the effectiveness.
23495,R3ID00232,2021-05-12T09:02:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very positive. I've already gotten mine, and plan to have my children get it as soon as it is approved for their ages."
23499,R3ID00241,2021-07-08T09:25:56Z,NA,NA,7,My partner and I both got it
23503,R3ID00244,2021-03-17T13:22:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
23504,R3ID00244,2021-05-14T09:02:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it
23514,R3ID00262,2021-05-12T07:07:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel like the vaccine is the lesser of two evils. Yes, it could have unknown side effects, but Covid likely has worse unknown side effects. My husband and I are fully vaccinated and we plan to get our oldest vaccinated ASAP (he?s 13)"
23525,R3ID00279,2021-03-17T18:16:42Z,NA,NA,NA,i am waiting for people i know get it
23527,R3ID00279,2021-04-15T19:13:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scheduled to get Mine next week

23535,R3ID00282,2021-07-08T13:06:17Z,NA,NA,NA,It is an emergency vaccine and still to early to know all of the effects it can have.
23541,R3ID00293,2021-04-14T07:25:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not have concerns. However some of the vaccinations are causing some interesting side effects in specific groups So I would likely avoid those if I hadn't already been vaccinated.
23548,R3ID00302,2021-04-14T09:38:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like the benefits outweigh the potential negatives and I have already received my first dose.
23549,R3ID00302,2021-07-07T09:25:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and I have received both doses.
23553,R3ID00313,2021-04-14T08:56:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my first dose.  I believe everyone capable should be vaccinated to prevent spread.
23560,R3ID00330,2021-05-12T07:20:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure of the long-term effects and am very hesitant to get it at this time
23565,R3ID00340,2021-03-17T16:41:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I have one!
23566,R3ID00340,2021-04-14T23:49:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I am pretty confident in the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.  I have some concerns about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and my friends/family who received that one.
23572,R3ID00342,2021-11-15T15:04:36Z,NA,NA,NA,The vaccine is amazing. It is even more safe and effective than we had any right to hope for. Everyone who us eligible in my family has been vaccinated. I intend to get my children vaccinated as soon as they are old enough.
23574,R3ID00345,2021-05-12T15:54:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have it
23578,R3ID00345,2021-09-16T22:26:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m already vaccinated
23579,R3ID00345,2021-10-13T21:44:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have it
23582,R3ID00349,2021-04-14T09:24:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Great. I have been fully vaccinated since mid February.
23585,R3ID00349,2021-12-10T09:42:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated (+ booster), my 5 year old is as well. All our family/friends are (we would not interact with them, especially indoors, otherwise). I feel great about it (if everyone would just get it)."
23586,R3ID00354,2021-03-17T09:36:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have mine (again, teacher) - hoping my spouse can get his soon"
23588,R3ID00355,2021-07-07T09:43:59Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I both received ours
23590,R3ID00358,2021-10-13T18:39:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Ive already received it
23592,R3ID00364,2021-06-10T08:03:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s fairly safe. I will get it when I can
23593,R3ID00364,2021-07-07T08:04:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is likely safe and seems somewhat effective. Many people I know have had bad reactions/felt sick after getting it (feed, chills, nausea/vomiting) so that makes me more hesitant to get it."
23599,R3ID00381,2021-03-17T20:47:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it. I trust the science and the vaccine. It is safe and effective.
23600,R3ID00381,2021-07-08T10:10:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it. I feel very confident in it's safety and efficacy.
23601,R3ID00381,2021-09-15T15:14:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel very good about it and I have been fully vaccinated since March 2021.
23602,R3ID00387,2021-03-18T12:20:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it to be safe and plan to get it right away when I am eligible
23607,R3ID00392,2021-11-12T09:10:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Both my parents and in-laws and my husband and myself are all fully vaccinated and scheduled to get the booster next week. My daughter turned 5 recently so she got her first pediatric dose this week. She was eager to get her vaccine after watching her entire adult family get protected. We trust science and are grateful for the added protection and peace of mind.
23610,R3ID00402,2021-04-14T12:56:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel neutral about it, and have already gotten it"
23616,R3ID00414,2021-06-11T14:14:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"Fine for adults, worried about kids"
23624,R3ID00443,2021-09-15T13:46:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I am pregnant so I will not be getting it until I give birth for sure
23626,R3ID00444,2021-03-18T12:37:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it. There is not enough research. We have had illnesses for years and years with no cures. I can not believe that there is enoug research for a vaccine so quickly
23630,R3ID00444,2021-11-14T09:40:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"We will not be getting it. There is not enough information on the long term effects for me to feel comfortable taking it. Now that its becoming available for 5-11 years of age, I'm concerned it may become required for school and that's very upsetting to me. I don't want to be forced to give my child something i don't feel comfortable with"
23636,R3ID00453,2021-07-07T19:09:12Z,NA,NA,NA,Feels confident both in terms of safety and effectiveness
23641,R3ID00457,2021-03-17T10:58:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Don't want to get it yet
23643,R3ID00457,2021-04-14T08:27:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Not completely comfortable but will get if can get the 1 dose
23645,R3ID00457,2021-05-12T07:18:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
23647,R3ID00457,2021-06-10T07:52:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's kinda scary all around, but needed."
23649,R3ID00457,2021-07-07T19:35:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not sure, but already got it."
23654,R3ID00457,2021-09-16T06:20:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it. If a chance why not juat do it.
23656,R3ID00457,2021-10-13T13:41:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got it. Slight concerns regarding safety due to rapid development, however id rather protect against the virus anywsy i can"
23658,R3ID00457,2021-11-10T10:04:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine. Still some concern about safety, however catching covid is a bigger scare so I feel the vaccine is necessary. I have not gotten covid even though there have been those around me that have, but I also do not get sick a lot I'm general. So I'm not sure about effectiveness."
23660,R3ID00457,2021-12-09T09:53:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I already got it. Some worries about the safety or effectiveness, however I'd rather do something than nothing regarding protecting myself and family from the pandemic."
23661,R3ID00458,2021-03-17T14:59:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safest and most effective vaccine in history, will get my shot once it's my turn"
23662,R3ID00458,2021-04-16T10:08:11Z,NA,NA,NA,Already fully vaccinated
23663,R3ID00458,2021-12-13T18:12:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Absolutely safe and worth the miniscule adverse risk. Not taking it is correlated with people who believe in personality cults rather than true beliefs of protecting others and safely mitigating risk.
23665,R3ID00480,2021-05-12T09:54:31Z,NA,NA,5,very hesitant
23667,R3ID00484,2021-12-08T12:50:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"All of my immediate family members who can get the shot, have it. As soon as my younger child can get vaccinated we will make it happen."
23668,R3ID00492,2021-03-17T09:31:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"As we are both working from home, it is not urgent for us to get it. I am concerned about my kids getting it as the both have epilepsy and I fear it triggering seizures."
23674,R3ID00558,2021-05-12T07:14:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I already got 1/2 doses, I fully support it."
23678,R3ID00558,2021-11-10T09:42:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaxxed and am all for everyone to get it.
23679,R3ID00558,2021-12-08T09:06:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is perfectly safe to get.
23681,R3ID00589,2021-10-14T15:45:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I've got it, and have no qualms with it."
23683,R3ID00601,2021-06-09T20:24:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's pretty safe, and we already got it."
23687,R3ID00601,2021-11-10T09:40:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Vaccines are around for many years. They are very effective. COVID-19 vaccine is no different. I think everyone should consider getting vaccinated - for their own health and others. I already got my shots.
23692,R3ID00647,2021-03-17T13:03:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Im just not sure about it
23698,R3ID00658,2021-05-12T18:26:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I have both doses of the vaccine and intend to give it to my children when they?re eligible.
23699,R3ID00658,2021-09-15T11:56:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it as soon as possible. It is extremely safe and effective and a true scientific miracle.
23706,R3ID00679,2021-12-08T12:38:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.  Our entire family is planning on getting fully vaccinated.
23716,R3ID00723,2021-09-15T09:16:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is fairly safe and I have gotten it
23717,R3ID00723,2021-11-10T11:05:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it and I?m not sure it?s effective at all, people I know who have gotten it have still gotten COVID so what?s the point"
23721,R3ID00737,2021-03-17T08:52:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Better than expected! Champing at the bit to get it when it's my turn
23722,R3ID00743,2021-03-19T19:49:19Z,NA,NA,NA,It feel very unreliable at the moment I?m very unsure of it
23726,R3ID00753,2021-03-17T11:33:15Z,NA,NA,6,Not confident
23732,R3ID00774,2021-10-13T09:26:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I am very much in favor of it and I have gotten mine and so has all of my family other than the children that are not eligible
23734,R3ID01156,2021-05-13T12:52:17Z,NA,NA,6,adults got it immediately but worry about the child ones
23744,R3ID01201,2021-07-07T09:12:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, horrible reaction. My child will not receive it right away"
23746,R3ID01207,2021-03-19T12:53:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Not unless I have to
23752,R3ID01207,2021-11-10T10:15:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not safe, Plan not to get it unless I have no choice"
23755,R3ID01224,2021-12-13T04:45:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it was awfully quick that they just came up with this shor when they do research on others for years before releasing
23759,R3ID01270,2021-10-13T17:52:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Already fully vaccinated
23761,R3ID01275,2021-06-09T09:36:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't feel safe about getting it, because it only protects against one strain of covid-19. I don't plan on getting it or having my children get it."
23767,R3ID01304,2021-03-19T12:53:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it at all.
23768,R3ID01304,2021-04-14T07:19:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it and won't get it.

23778,R3ID01307,2021-04-14T07:09:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I officially have been completely vaccinated for a week as of today. I?m so very grateful to have it but I?m scared my children will get it and die!
23780,R3ID01313,2021-03-18T13:37:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Highly confident and will get it as soon as possible
23781,R3ID01313,2021-10-13T13:44:03Z,NA,NA,NA,fully vaccinated and already scheduled for booster shot; pro vaccination

23790,R3ID01339,2021-07-08T08:56:47Z,NA,NA,6,I know not all side effects are being reported so I am concerned about the vaccine.
23791,R3ID01339,2021-10-14T14:50:11Z,NA,NA,NA,Hesitant
23796,R3ID01368,2021-12-12T17:07:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the vaccine is safe and effective. I have gotten all 3 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
23797,R3ID01376,2021-03-19T12:55:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"The more I see people I know get it without too much consequence,  the safer I feel it is. I do plan on getting it when it is made available to me."
23798,R3ID01376,2021-05-13T12:16:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm confident in it's effectiveness and am already vaccinated
23799,R3ID01376,2021-12-14T12:29:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already received it and the booster shot. I feel it is effective and my family does as well.
23811,R3ID01408,2021-03-17T16:49:48Z,NA,NA,2,"I don?t feel it?s completely safe, or 100% effective. People who are elderly or at risk should take take it. I am healthy, and do not planning on getting it."
23816,R3ID01444,2021-07-09T07:47:44Z,NA,NA,NA,It's safe and both my partner and I are vaccinated.
23818,R3ID01444,2021-11-15T01:36:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's safe and necessary to stop the pandemic and I am fully vaccinated.

23824,R3ID01507,2021-04-14T12:20:05Z,NA,NA,NA,The vaccine has not been around long enough to know how safe it is years down the road.  I do not plan to get the vaccine because I already caught Covid so should have some immunity from that.
23830,R3ID01511,2021-05-13T12:41:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Not confident in it. Will not be getting it
23840,R3ID01702,2021-06-10T01:52:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm holding off on getting the vaccine until they are a bit more vetted.  But once i feel they are safe u will certainly get the vaccination
23842,R3ID01702,2021-09-16T10:14:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I've had the 1st shot but it made me so incredibly ill in hesitant to take the 2nd shot
23843,R3ID01702,2021-12-15T07:42:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I think its relatively safe but made me very sick so I only took 1
23844,R3ID01706,2021-04-14T08:23:12Z,NA,NA,3,Will get it eventually but will not get it the first round
23846,R3ID01714,2021-04-14T07:03:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident enough in it's safeness and effectiveness to receive the vaccine but still skeptical

23854,R3ID01727,2021-04-14T07:03:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m thinking about getting it but I?m still concerned because of how new it is
23855,R3ID01727,2021-10-16T14:19:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vaccine is safe and I have already received both doses.
23859,R3ID01733,2021-03-17T09:03:34Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s up in the air for me
23861,R3ID01733,2021-04-14T07:07:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Still on the fence about the safety and side effect. I?m good with the efficacy of the vaccine itself.
23863,R3ID01733,2021-05-12T07:13:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m in between shots
23869,R3ID01733,2021-09-16T08:29:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enough info available for young children
23871,R3ID01733,2021-10-18T06:05:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already
23873,R3ID01733,2021-11-14T13:35:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it but have buyers remorse to be honest
23875,R3ID01733,2021-12-10T13:41:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve received it. Rather get it than die from covid.
23879,R3ID01761,2021-10-16T09:23:22Z,NA,NA,6,All for it! Got it myself. And looking forward to get a booster shit soon.
23883,R3ID01771,2021-04-14T08:59:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I am still debating about whether or not to get it. My feelings are a lot of unknowns
23884,R3ID01771,2021-07-07T12:26:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got my first one, believe it's safe"
23886,R3ID01774,2021-06-09T20:19:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I have mine. My children are both eager to get theirs because all the adults they know have it.
23889,R3ID01774,2021-09-15T19:03:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I know there are risks but I worry. I don?t know I have a choice.

23896,R3ID01776,2021-03-18T13:05:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Comfortable

23907,R3ID01793,2021-12-08T11:16:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I am comforted by  its effectiveness in preventing serious illness or death.  I have  been vaccinated since March 2021 and just got my booster.   (Pfizer)
23910,R3ID01798,2021-05-14T12:47:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"Ive already gotten it, i am hoping that they make it available for children too"
23912,R3ID01811,2021-03-19T01:34:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m slightly hesitant to receive it but will definitely get it at some point as long as it is safe and effective.
23915,R3ID01811,2021-07-09T14:37:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m slightly hesitant but hoping it works.
23919,R3ID01812,2021-05-12T11:21:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Needs more time
23920,R3ID01812,2021-06-10T06:36:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enough data
23921,R3ID01812,2021-09-15T10:03:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure. Feel like there is not enough information and don?t know which information to believe. Things change day to day and it?s very unsettling.
23926,R3ID01813,2021-04-16T17:50:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten one shot and my husband is fully vaccinated. We're not concerned about safety, but we don't feel like information is easily available from trustworthy sources about how long the vaccine will last and how much of the population will need to be vaccinated for herd immunity."
23927,R3ID01813,2021-06-11T09:40:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have gotten it.

23933,R3ID01815,2021-10-13T08:38:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it

23944,R3ID01827,2021-12-12T10:47:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel totally fine. I javelin received my vaccine as well as the booster. I feel it's no different than any of the other vaccinations I've received over the years.
23948,R3ID01841,2021-04-14T08:22:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm excited about the efficacy of the available vaccines and have an appointment for my first dose on Saturday!
23949,R3ID01841,2021-07-07T19:59:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m perfectly comfortable with the safety data I?ve heard about and have been vaccinated
23959,R3ID01874,2021-04-14T07:11:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is a risk we have to take, like I prefer to take a vaccine than contract the virus. Though it is worrying that some of the vaccines are showing very dangerous side effects and on the other hand, it?s effectiveness is questionable because there are many variants of the virus so technically you take the vaccine and know that if you get the virus is not going to attack you that hard. I took my first shot already"
23961,R3ID01874,2021-05-12T08:33:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is good to get it, because it will help us fight any variant of virus in case we get it. I am fully vaccinated"
23973,R3ID01931,2021-09-15T10:32:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it?s probably safe and relatively effective. I feel like my immune system is probably more effective though, and since I?ve already had COVID, I likely won?t get vaccinated."
23975,R3ID01931,2021-11-13T11:27:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it?s safe and relatively effective. If I hadn?t had COVID already I would get vaccinated. At this point, I feel like my own immune system is just as effective as the vaccine, and until I see evidence proving otherwise, I probably won?t be vaccinated."
23979,R3ID01955,2021-03-17T11:37:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I am interested in getting the vaccine for myself as an adult and would need to know more information bout the vaccine trials for young children before having my young child vaccinated
23981,R3ID01955,2021-10-17T01:57:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in the efficacy of the vaccine and have revived the appropriate doses per cdc guidelines
23982,R3ID01955,2021-11-12T10:40:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I have confidence in the science behind the vaccine and have already received the vaccine myself

23986,R3ID01963,2021-09-15T10:05:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's very safe and effective. I got it as soon as I was eligible, back in March. I'm very grateful."
23989,R3ID01963,2021-12-08T11:46:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is very safe and effective. I just got a booster.
23995,R3ID01972,2021-11-10T10:47:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel the vaccine is safe and effective. I received the vaccine, and I will get my child vaccinated when it is available for his age group."

23999,R3ID01991,2021-10-13T08:28:05Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective (but less effective on delta) and i got it when i could
24002,R3ID01997,2021-03-17T09:41:16Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective- I have gotten it
24007,R3ID02003,2021-11-10T09:38:21Z,NA,NA,NA,i have it and will get it for my child the very minute it's available
24009,R3ID02003,2021-12-14T14:26:20Z,NA,NA,NA,the vaccine is great - a miracle of science - and i will continue to get boosters as recommended. it makes me feel much more safe and secure. limited effectiveness against new variants just means science will catch up quickly.
24011,R3ID02007,2021-04-14T07:18:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I was very happy to get the vaccine and hope there is a vaccine for my son soon.

24023,R3ID02020,2021-09-15T10:20:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I think everyone should get it to protect the people and children who cannot get vaccinated. I already got my 2 doses of the vaccine in May 2021.
24025,R3ID02029,2021-03-17T21:09:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it?s effectiveness and want to get it when I am eligible.
24026,R3ID02029,2021-04-14T19:48:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about what is out there and have receive the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
24029,R3ID02042,2021-12-08T14:55:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was coerced into getting it. It was either get it and continue to be able to provide for my family and continue a 23yr career, or not get it and have to figure something else out."

24068,R3ID02181,2021-07-08T09:42:26Z,NA,NA,4,Still not vaccinated. I continue to use a mask for me and my children. Not sure we will get it.

I've gotten both shots and will get booster if advised.  I will get vaccine for daughter when it is age appropriate."
24122,R3ID02258,2021-12-09T06:31:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is effective, or at least as effective as possible in the short time frame they had in development. I've had both initial vaccines and my booster."

I already have it and as soon as the research comes out that says its safe for my son, we will get it for him. I will get whatever boosters or other vaccines that research shows are needed and effective."

24202,R3ID02333,2021-07-08T06:13:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s too early to tell whether it?s safe and effective. I will be waiting to see the outcome of the people that got it.

24225,R3ID02358,2021-11-12T09:37:35Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have gotten it and boosters and our daughter will get it Saturday. We are big proponents of getting it and using it to build immunity and stay safe.
24231,R3ID02367,2021-03-18T12:24:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"Ive studied, i believe i would get it for the adults and wait for the children until i see how it would affect people long term."
24233,R3ID02367,2021-11-10T09:36:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not wish to get the vaccine without more time to verify the necessity. 
Our COVID experience - my husband was diagnosed with a positive COVID result from weekly checks at work. He had no symptoms. We assumed the entire family had it so we just quarantined with him and we did not, literally any of us, show any symptoms whatsoever. When you get the vaccine, you can still get COVID; still spread COVID and still have to mask up so there is literally no point unless you fit into a category of higher risk than the average person. 

For the immunocompromised and the elderly, I think the vaccine is great. For healthy, normal children and adults it?s completely unnecessary and it?s disgusting to ever try to mandate any sort of medical treatment. Asinine and unconstitutional. I can?t believe workplaces are even allowed to offer money for getting it and push people towards it or FIRE them if they don?t!! Insane!"
24240,R3ID02370,2021-11-10T11:27:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it. It seems like it is super effective except for against the variants. As far as safety goes, I am concerned because it is so new but all of the scientists have said it is safe so I have to trust them"
24244,R3ID02374,2021-04-16T00:13:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe. I got it
24246,R3ID02375,2021-07-09T10:01:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my vaccine
24250,R3ID02379,2021-07-07T16:03:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine as soon as I could in order to protect my parents and my child. I feel like it is not as safe as I would like since it hasn't been tested very long and we still don't perfectly understand the virus. But it felt safe enough for me. Especially as I got the mrna version
24253,R3ID02379,2021-10-13T23:54:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am usually vaccine hesitant. We do not get flu shots, and my child was on an alternate vaccine schedule. But we got our covid vaccines as soon as we were able"
24259,R3ID02382,2021-07-09T09:56:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's necessary, and safe, in that order. Every adult in my immediate and extended family are all fully vaccinated. Can't wait till the kids can get it"
24265,R3ID02387,2021-03-17T21:54:50Z,NA,NA,4,I am undecided
24272,R3ID02393,2021-12-08T22:00:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not believe it is either safe or effective. I will not be getting it.
24278,R3ID02403,2021-04-14T11:33:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Still reviewing for decision
24282,R3ID02408,2021-03-17T08:57:44Z,NA,NA,NA,My family & I definitely will not get the vaccine. We don?t use any vaccines.
24283,R3ID02408,2021-06-09T09:50:39Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s still experimental & my family & I will not be getting it.
24285,R3ID02408,2021-09-15T08:03:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust it at all & my family & I will not be getting the jab.
24287,R3ID02408,2021-11-10T09:31:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"My family will not be getting the vaccine, as we don?t take any vaccines."
24302,R3ID031256,2021-03-18T01:12:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident in its safety and effectiveness and I can't wait to get a shot (I am not yet eligible by Oregon's guidelines)
24308,R3ID031256,2021-11-10T10:34:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received the COVID vaccine as a frontline worker as soon as I was able. I am scheduled for my booster later this month. My spouse received a vaccine as soon as possible and is scheduled for a booster next month. We will vaccinate our children as soon as possible. The vaccine is our best defense against serious illness and longterm health impacts of COVID-19 and while our children remain unvaccinated we are very cautious about spending time around groups of people, especially groups that may potentially have other unvaccinated people, children or adults."
24318,R3ID02512,2021-07-08T11:36:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m not sure, but I got it already."
24321,R3ID02512,2021-11-12T17:29:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
24323,R3ID02512,2021-12-14T20:48:02Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are vaccinated and I will be getting my booster this week. We plan to have our 5 year old vaccinated when it?s next available (difficult to find)
24329,R3ID02513,2021-07-07T10:32:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it?s safe, effective, completely worth it. I?m fully vaccinated"
24331,R3ID02517,2021-03-17T13:26:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I'll probably get it but want to be well informed about the risks.
24333,R3ID02517,2021-07-08T12:57:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated. Crossing fingers it's ok.
24336,R3ID02517,2021-10-14T21:01:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is safe and effective, and am fully vaccinated."
24338,R3ID02523,2021-12-12T08:27:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is very safe and effective. I've already got my first two shots; my husband got his booster yesterday. I'll be getting my booster later this month. I'm looking forward to when my child can get her shots, too.
"
24341,R3ID02526,2021-04-15T00:02:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not enough research, need more time to gather data for breastfeeding moms and children. More time to see long term effects. Will not be getting it in 2021"
24342,R3ID02526,2021-05-12T18:26:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not feel there is enough long term research, my family and I will not be getting it for a few years at least"
24343,R3ID02526,2021-06-10T08:12:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"We will not be getting it until we see the long term side effects of the vaccine, it was developed too rapidly with little testing"
24344,R3ID02526,2021-07-07T11:21:14Z,NA,NA,NA,My family will not be getting it. I don't trust it's safety
24346,R3ID02529,2021-04-14T07:05:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I just received my second Moderna dose yesterday.
24347,R3ID02529,2021-05-12T09:08:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe.  I received my two doses in April.
24352,R3ID02533,2021-05-12T15:16:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's significantly safer than chancing the virus itself and both Pfizer and Moderna have excellent effective rates. I have received both doses of Pfizer, as has my spouse, and will get glad for my children as soon as emergency authorization includes their age groups."
24353,R3ID02533,2021-06-11T09:04:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's been tested as thoroughly as possible and is a much lower risk to us than the virus.
24355,R3ID02533,2021-09-16T21:16:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is significantly less risky than the virus and extraordinarily unlikely to cause long term harm.
24359,R3ID02534,2021-04-14T07:59:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it but my friend had a very severe reaction to the shot and it?s stressing me out for my children
24361,R3ID02534,2021-07-07T09:17:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it. I had a friend who seems to have had a very sever reaction to the vaccine and she has been sick for 3 months from it. That makes me hesitate, but  I think I will get it for my children."
24363,R3ID02534,2021-10-13T08:18:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it and I trust it
24369,R3ID02535,2021-06-09T08:07:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have already received it, and we are fully confident that it is safe and effective. Our kids will get it once it's available to them."
24372,R3ID02535,2021-09-16T08:07:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have already gotten it, and we will definitely get it for all 3 of our kids once it's available. I believe that it is safe and that it will basically completely protect them from having to be hospitalized due to covid."
24378,R3ID02543,2021-04-16T12:41:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel slightly more hesitant than I have with other vaccines, but I still plan on getting it and feel like it?s safe."
24381,R3ID02543,2021-11-12T10:24:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and I believe it to be very safe and effective. I believe if more people had gotten the vaccine I wouldn?t have been diagnosed with a positive result after having gotten the vaccine myself.
24383,R3ID02543,2021-12-08T10:13:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is both safe and effective, and I have received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine as well as a booster shot. I was diagnosed with COVID-19 four months after getting my second dose and while I was disappointed that it didn?t stop me from getting it, my symptoms were less severe and I was able to get over it within a week. I attribute that to my being vaccinated."
24386,R3ID02544,2021-03-17T09:11:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it and have already received my first shot
24388,R3ID02544,2021-04-14T07:45:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it. I will get it for my kids as soon as it's approved for their age group.
24389,R3ID02544,2021-06-09T09:37:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I will definitely get my kids vaccinated as soon as they are eligible
24392,R3ID02548,2021-06-09T12:07:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received the vaccine as well as the other adults in our household. The safety and efficacy seem well established.
24398,R3ID02551,2021-05-14T12:31:03Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it is safe, everyone eligible in my house has received it!"
24405,R3ID02556,2021-07-07T09:16:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"Neither myself, my spouse, or my children plan to get it. I do not feel it?s effective, nor do I completely trust that it is safe yet."
24406,R3ID02556,2021-12-08T08:02:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not trust it, and do not want to receive it yet."
24408,R3ID02560,2021-03-19T15:51:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I am hopeful that it is effective and have already gotten mine
24409,R3ID02560,2021-11-10T12:15:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten mine. I viewed it just like I have any other vaccine I have gotten, if there is a chance that it helps me stay healthy and not end up in the hospital it is worth it. The benefits outweigh the risks associated with it."
24410,R3ID02560,2021-12-14T13:32:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it
24413,R3ID02570,2021-07-07T14:24:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Don?t trust at all
24415,R3ID02570,2021-09-15T19:16:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Don?t trust the manufacturers or the government
24418,R3ID02574,2021-06-10T19:31:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safer than getting COVID. I have already received the vaccine.
24424,R3ID02581,2021-06-11T11:21:19Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I both got it - feel very safe about it
24429,R3ID02583,2021-05-12T12:18:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I get my second shot this week.
24433,R3ID02595,2021-07-09T14:35:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I question it
24437,R3ID02606,2021-03-17T09:13:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am confident in the vaccine's safety and efficacy. I am currently pregnant, so I am not sure yet whether I will get the vaccine while pregnant or wait until afterwards because of the lack of studies on pregnant women. If I do not get it while pregnant, I will get it as soon as I can afterwards."
24438,R3ID02606,2021-04-14T07:09:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it is safe and effective, and I have received my first dose."
24439,R3ID02606,2021-06-10T08:16:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about its safety and effectiveness. I have already received the vaccine.
24444,R3ID02610,2021-03-17T13:10:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Not to get it
24447,R3ID02613,2021-03-17T09:15:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I am hopeful and excited to get the vaccine!
24459,R3ID02624,2021-11-10T10:19:11Z,NA,NA,NA,Should be a choice
24461,R3ID02626,2021-03-17T10:13:21Z,NA,NA,NA,i don't trust that it's safe
24463,R3ID02626,2021-06-09T11:32:46Z,NA,NA,NA,i don't trust it yet
24466,R3ID02632,2021-06-10T08:26:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Still undecided.
24472,R3ID02638,2021-06-09T13:54:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan on receiving the vaccine or vaccinating my family until the military makes it mandatory and I have no choice
24479,R3ID02639,2021-04-15T09:29:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure if it is safe, unsure if I'm getting it till it is fda approved"
24481,R3ID02639,2021-05-13T08:49:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure.  I don't want my kids getting it
24490,R3ID02651,2021-04-14T08:29:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I cannot wait to get my second dose of the vaccine tomorrow!
24491,R3ID02651,2021-05-13T13:34:42Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are fully vaccinated.
24494,R3ID02651,2021-10-13T12:16:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe and have received my two doses.
24499,R3ID02656,2021-10-16T12:03:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it was too rushed and is causing side effects. I likely won't for safety reasons, and I'm breastfeeding"
24502,R3ID02660,2021-05-14T13:02:00Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I have already gotten it and our son will when it is available
24505,R3ID02660,2021-12-08T16:18:11Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I have gotton our first two doses. We are asking our doctors about boosters. My son will get it as soon as he is eligable.
24507,R3ID02675,2021-03-19T09:09:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel scared. The vaccine is not well tested; so many get sick after the second round. I?m not ready to have anyone in my family take it. I trust that our health is in God?s hands.
24509,R3ID02678,2021-07-07T09:08:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Me and my family are not getting it. We don't trust it

24512,R3ID02680,2021-05-12T17:20:43Z,NA,NA,7,Fully vaccinated currently
24516,R3ID02681,2021-10-13T08:43:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure yet
24519,R3ID02687,2021-05-14T13:25:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Vaccines work and they are the reason we live as long as we do now. I am fully vaccinated and our local children's hospital has begun a trial for kids 5+ so we hope our child will be able to get it after turning 5.
24523,R3ID02687,2021-10-16T09:38:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are already vaccinated and because I work in schools part-time, I?ll get a booster in a few weeks. We feel the vaccines are safe and effective and are disappointed by anyone who doesn?t."
24524,R3ID02687,2021-11-12T09:59:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel very confident in the vaccine's safety and am aware that the effectiveness is only as good as adoption. The vaccine prevents cases in 8 of 10 or 9 of 10 situations of exposure. Those are incredible odds! I have already been vaccinated, will get a booster (as a part-time teacher), and have already taken our 5-year-old for their first dose."
24525,R3ID02690,2021-12-14T14:31:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's as safe and as effective as any other vaccine. I have received both doses of the vaccine and I plan to get my kids vaccinated as well.
24530,R3ID02703,2021-04-15T04:46:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am still skeptical about its effectiveness but I do believe it is safe. I have been vaccinated. I feel it can only help, not hurt."
24532,R3ID02703,2021-05-13T14:25:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"Uncertain of its effectiveness but I believe getting it will only help, not hurt if I am exposed to Covid-19. I have been vaccinated"

24536,R3ID02703,2021-07-09T06:17:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the vaccine. I believe it is safe but feel that it?s effectiveness is yet to be determined

24544,R3ID02703,2021-12-08T18:15:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe. Still question the level of effectiveness
24551,R3ID02716,2021-11-14T13:47:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that its not a somution but a way to reduce the spread. i feel the need for precautions still exist.
24552,R3ID02719,2021-05-12T15:32:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm confident it's safe and effective and have receive both shots as of April.
24556,R3ID02720,2021-07-07T08:12:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not comfortable with it and do not plan to get it
24559,R3ID02720,2021-10-13T08:22:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to get it. It hasn?t been tested long term
24562,R3ID02720,2021-12-12T09:00:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust it and don?t intend to get it
24565,R3ID02722,2021-06-09T09:26:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe. I received

24569,R3ID02722,2021-12-14T12:44:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe - seems fairly effective at preventing or preventing hospitalizations. I have received all 2 doses.
24570,R3ID02726,2021-09-15T21:13:09Z,NA,NA,NA,It's approved and therefore safe. Already vaccinated.
24574,R3ID02730,2021-05-12T08:47:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I've already gotten both my shots of the Moderna vaccine. I'm lucky that I didn't have too awful side effects but in my opinion, the side effects are worth it to avoid COVID."
24579,R3ID02731,2021-05-12T10:20:02Z,NA,NA,NA,We are not getting it for a while
24580,R3ID02731,2021-10-13T08:48:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Too soon to know
24581,R3ID02731,2021-12-11T05:39:25Z,NA,NA,NA,We will not be getting it any time soon. We are a family loaded with allergies and very poorly reactive to a numerous amount of medications.

24605,R3ID02751,2021-06-09T15:52:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"Pretty good. I got my second shot about 3 weeks  ago and am very comfortable with the vaccine for adults.  I would like to see more info on kids before my young kids get it, but will have them vaccinated when we can"
24606,R3ID02751,2021-07-08T15:28:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been fully vaccinated
24608,R3ID02751,2021-09-16T15:30:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Ok. My spouse and I both got vaccinated as soon as we could.
24610,R3ID02751,2021-10-14T14:30:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe enough I got vaccinated as soon as I could
24611,R3ID02751,2021-12-10T13:00:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I wish it were more effective against the new variants. I just got my booster and was extremely wiped out for a day. I plan to keep up to date with all recommended boosters.
24616,R3ID02756,2021-05-13T14:18:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust the system for the most part in testing and rolling out the vaccine. I already have my two shots. My children are too young to receive it. My parents, in-laws, and numerous family and friends have all received their vaccine."
24619,R3ID02757,2021-04-16T11:41:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received my first dose, I believe it is just as safe as any vaccine we currently have."
24621,R3ID02759,2021-12-12T19:39:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"With the reactions between one or both vaccine shots I would rather stick with just the one shot when I do get it. Same goes for the kids, I am waiting for there to be a one shot vaccine for them. The effectiveness is there but it does still need to be improved so everyone would only need 1 or 2 shots a year to stay vaccinated."
24624,R3ID02774,2021-09-17T12:41:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Everyone in my immediate and extended family is fully vaccinated. We plan on vaccinating our children as soon as we can.
24628,R3ID02781,2021-04-15T17:00:28Z,NA,NA,NA,The adults in our family are vaccinated and believe in the vaccines.
24632,R3ID02784,2021-05-12T13:20:35Z,NA,NA,NA,No long term testing so we won?t do it.
24633,R3ID02785,2021-09-17T15:11:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m wary of it and do not plan to get it for several years at least. The coercion is making me think we should avoid this vaccine at all costs.
24635,R3ID02795,2021-10-13T09:54:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am still unsure because my family and i are high risk and have adverse reactions to immunizations. But again, covid was a terrifying experience. We just do not know enough."
24636,R3ID02795,2021-11-11T14:18:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am scared, honestly. I am still educating myself on the vaccine before I receive it. I am worried about the side effects as well as it's effectiveness vs amount of harm."
24639,R3ID02810,2021-06-09T15:10:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"Too risky for our family (questionable effects, especially for fertility, no idea what the long-term a effects could be) and we don't plan on getting it at all."
24640,R3ID02810,2021-07-07T23:48:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not safe at all; no PROVEN efficacy or true safety, no way of knowing how it will alter our health as we age, and many other concerns. We won't be receiving"
24645,R3ID02815,2021-03-17T10:05:24Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are getting our first dose this afternoon!!

24700,R3ID02839,2021-10-13T10:58:18Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I are both fully vaccinated. I woke in the middle of the night to try to secure appointments for both of us to get vaccinated as soon as we could. I will do the same the moment vaccines are announced for my children.
24706,R3ID02841,2021-11-10T16:06:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I support the vaccine. I am currently due to get my booster shot. My son is still too young to get his shot, but I will be sure to get his flu shot at his appointment next week."

24736,R3ID02866,2021-05-14T07:33:32Z,NA,NA,NA,My wife and I have received it and trust the science.
24739,R3ID02866,2021-10-16T08:11:50Z,NA,NA,NA,We are both vaccinated. We are supportive of the vaccine.
24741,R3ID02866,2021-12-10T08:18:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"My wife and I are fully vaccinated and recently boosted. Our 5 year old has two doses and is on the road to efficacy. We are anxiously awaiting the approval for our youngest two.  My wife has a nursing background and I trust her and the experts.  If this is what we must to do protect our kids and others, why would we even hesitate?"
24743,R3ID02869,2021-07-07T09:11:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I was vaccinated early
24748,R3ID02873,2021-03-17T11:31:48Z,NA,NA,4,We will be getting it. It makes me feel a bit safer around others who are not taking the same pre-cautions

24762,R3ID02885,2021-11-10T16:43:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it and trust that the proper tests have been done to be sure that it is safe. Any risks of the vaccine are preferable to the risks or getting COVID-19. I have already gotten both doses of the vaccine and will get a booster if needed.
24766,R3ID02887,2021-10-14T08:04:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Probably safe enough but not proven to be safe and effective long term. What I?ve seen shows natural immunity is the best drug. My job is pressuring us to get it and I may cave soon.

24790,R3ID02899,2021-04-14T21:07:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my first dose. I believe  it is safe but am unsure of it?s real-world effectiveness in the face of a virus that evolves the longer it lives

Will also look at international certification - if it is not approved in Europe for his age group I?d want to know why.
24974,R3ID029582,2021-05-13T09:57:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already gotten the vaccine and believe it to be safe and effective. I felt a weight lifted off me knowing I wouldn't die and leave my kids without a mom.
24980,R3ID029583,2021-05-12T10:16:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I fully believe in the vaccine. All vaccines had to start somewhere. My husband and i have already received the covid vaccine.
24985,R3ID029588,2021-05-12T19:29:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure about safety and effectiveness, but I am fully vaccinated."
24986,R3ID029588,2021-06-10T06:02:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it?s safe, and I received it."
24991,R3ID029588,2021-11-12T11:41:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated.
24997,R3ID029595,2021-04-14T09:23:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Got round 1!!! I?m so excited to have it.
24998,R3ID029595,2021-06-09T10:44:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m already vaccinated!!! I would prefer 1% immunity y to o 0%. The risks I take when taking birth control are higher than the vaccine. And I take my birth control!
25000,R3ID029595,2021-12-11T04:24:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it! Can?t wait for my youngest to turn 5 and get it. Science has demonstrated that it is safe and it is imperative to get the vaccine if you are physically able.
25010,R3ID029614,2021-07-07T17:24:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I did get it and wish everyone would
25014,R3ID029615,2021-09-15T09:35:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had it already. I am confident that it will help us to stay as healthy as possible or keep the virus from being too severe if contracted
25019,R3ID029618,2021-06-09T16:45:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I had concerns about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I felt comfortable with the moderna and we already received it
25021,R3ID029618,2021-07-07T10:02:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I felt comfortable with it and my husband and I already got the Moderna shots. We still are more cautious about washing hands and distancing because it isn't completely effective.
25024,R3ID029618,2021-12-14T12:33:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"While there is still a risk of getting Covid even with the vaccine, I think the decrease in risk of getting covid and decreased risk of hospitalization makes any risks from the vaccine worth it."
25027,R3ID029628,2021-09-15T08:44:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s effective and I got 2 doses already
25031,R3ID029629,2021-09-16T15:22:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I am finished with my vaccinations.
25034,R3ID029637,2021-03-17T11:08:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scheduled to get my first dose in two days. I trust science and I believe it will be safe and effective.
25035,R3ID029637,2021-11-10T11:00:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and I have already gotten it
25037,R3ID029638,2021-04-14T07:43:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I will be getting it soon. I'm currently pregnant to protect me and my baby.
25038,R3ID029638,2021-07-07T11:56:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Already have received the shot.
25041,R3ID029638,2021-10-13T14:30:37Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it while pregnant
25044,R3ID029638,2021-12-14T14:54:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it and received it during pregnancy
25047,R3ID029640,2021-05-12T10:21:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel its safe and I'm already fully vaccinated
25049,R3ID029641,2021-03-19T16:55:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"Feel the risks outweigh the benefits right now.  Not against getting the vaccine, but waiting until more studies are done, especially for safety."
25050,R3ID029641,2021-04-14T18:02:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"The safety profile is concerning to me, and I don't think the effectiveness is enough to warrant taking the risk of getting the vaccine.  After further research is completed, this might change, but currently I do not plan to get the vacccine."
25053,R3ID029643,2021-07-08T08:09:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Not confident in long term safety due to lack of data over time
25057,R3ID029646,2021-03-18T03:45:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I will absolutely get it. There are two healthcare workers in my home with direct contact with covid patients. I need to keep myself from spreading it if I get exposed.
25060,R3ID029662,2021-07-08T17:35:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are both fully vaccinated so I definitely support it.  We are a bit more iffy about our daughter due to the recent heart inflammation reports, but still want to have her get it."
25061,R3ID029662,2021-11-13T01:50:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was very excited about getting it and my husband and I drove far away just to get both doses as the closer spots were all booked. I trust its safety. Originally I thought maybe it was a little rushed, but with millions of people taking all the various kinds, we have pretty good data now haha."
25064,R3ID029663,2021-07-07T15:20:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Im not getting it. I dont trust that we have had enough time to dully test it and i plan on having more children. I dont want to risk it causing problems.
25071,R3ID029665,2021-07-07T08:11:16Z,NA,NA,NA,We will get it but I am slightly worried about the safety for children
25073,R3ID029665,2021-09-15T08:06:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel ok with the safety and believe it is better to have it than nothing and all adults in our family have received it
25079,R3ID029666,2021-03-18T03:07:43Z,NA,NA,NA,we will be getting the vaccination. Side effects are inevitable no matter the vaccine but are still a lesser evil than what they protect the public from
25082,R3ID029672,2021-03-17T08:54:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not getting it. None of the vaccines have been f.d.a. Approved and because it was mass produced quickly there isn?t enough evidence or trials convincing enough of its long term safety or side effects
25084,R3ID029672,2021-04-14T09:17:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that this vaccine was rushed, I feel that I will not be getting the vaccine until I can see how it affects people"
25086,R3ID029672,2021-05-12T11:13:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it hasn?t been researched enough, I feel like it?s a personal choice to get it or not. I?ve already gotten my first dose"
25088,R3ID029672,2021-07-07T09:46:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?ve received the vaccine, I?m not really sure on effectiveness or safety as it is new"
25091,R3ID029672,2021-11-10T10:36:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Already Received- I hope that it works and helps. I hope they come up with a better formula as to where if you are vaccinated then you don?t need to worry
25092,R3ID029675,2021-06-11T08:18:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm on the fence you hear alot of bad things about it, but I also want to protect my family"
25095,R3ID029676,2021-03-18T13:56:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I feel good about it.
25098,R3ID029678,2021-07-08T09:20:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated but my son is too young to get the shot.
25101,R3ID029678,2021-11-12T09:42:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that even though it does not fully prevent the COVID virus it does help the symptoms be less severe.
25106,R3ID029680,2021-04-14T07:04:21Z,NA,NA,NA,mRNA has been studied long enough that i feel comfortable with what we currently know about the vaccine safety and effectiveness. i have already received my first dose.
25112,R3ID029680,2021-12-08T10:07:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is safe and effective, given the research I have read. I received both shots while pregnant and plan to get a booster next month."
25113,R3ID029681,2021-06-09T09:12:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I had covid19 several months ago as did everyone in my household. I hate being sick and am scared of experiencing side effects (flu like symptoms) from the vaccination. I also do not wish to give my child a vaccination that we know such little on. It is too new for my comfort.
25116,R3ID029681,2021-09-15T08:45:15Z,NA,NA,NA,My anxiety is so bad that id probably make myself sick for days after getting the vaccine.
25120,R3ID029684,2021-04-14T15:53:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"One shot down, one to go!"
25126,R3ID029684,2021-09-15T10:50:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, I?m thrilled to have it."
25127,R3ID029684,2021-10-13T08:42:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, I?m happy to have it, nervous about the kids ones in light of the low risk to kids, really unsure who to trust there."
25129,R3ID029684,2021-11-10T11:12:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, thrilled to be protected."
25131,R3ID029684,2021-12-08T20:31:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, plan to get a booster shortly. I have some concerns about my 5 year old, but am still hoping to get him vaccinated very shortly. I must get my husband on board to feel comfortable doing so. (Not because he knows better--he doesn't-- but because I don't think it's right to do this until we're both comfortable)."
25134,R3ID029688,2021-06-11T11:41:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received. I feel great about it.
25135,R3ID029692,2021-05-12T08:57:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't think enough peer reviewed testing and studies have been conducted, and I don't want to get it or have it administered to my children."
25136,R3ID029692,2021-06-10T05:53:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"We want to get it, but can't afford to miss any work, so if we get sick from the vaccine it will be detrimental, and we'll need to stagger our appointments and plan for when we will be able to take time off."
25137,R3ID029692,2021-09-17T14:01:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was very hesitant at first, but I have gotten the first dose already."
25140,R3ID029697,2021-12-09T20:44:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got it, got boosted, hope everyone gets it. It's very safe and anti vaxers drive me crazy"
25143,R3ID029703,2021-06-09T09:40:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it because covid is worse than the vaccine
25144,R3ID029703,2021-10-13T08:17:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and need to get my next dose
25145,R3ID029703,2021-12-08T22:28:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am glad I had it, wish my family would get it, waiting for younger kids so my daughter can get it"
25147,R3ID029704,2021-03-19T09:03:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it and have received it.
25148,R3ID029704,2021-06-10T09:45:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it will end the pandemic. It is very safe and very effective.I have already received it.
25149,R3ID029704,2021-09-16T13:54:20Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective. I have gotten it.
25153,R3ID029709,2021-07-07T09:51:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it.
25156,R3ID029712,2021-03-19T11:50:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"It seems that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been well developed, well researched, and are resulting in a vast majority of healthy, positive outcomes. The side effects that the majority people complain of seem to be uncomfortable, but temporary. I am trying to get the vaccine myself. If a vaccine becomes available for children, my children will get it."
25157,R3ID029713,2021-05-12T10:04:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had my first vaccine and get my second next week.
25158,R3ID029713,2021-07-08T13:13:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel confident in its ability to prevent or lessen the symptoms of covid. My husband and I are both fully vaccinated.
25161,R3ID029713,2021-12-12T11:03:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are vaccinated and plan to get boosters. My oldest children (8 and 7) have had their first shot and will get their second in the new year. I believe that the vaccine for us simply helps not spread COVID.  I don?t think we would be in danger of severe illness because of our good health, but this virus has unsuspectedly affected some very healthy people in a major way too. Gavin the vaccinations it makes me feel that we will be protected from having to be hospitalized from the virus. From what I hear the vast majority of people in hospitals and dying from COVID are unvaccinated."
25164,R3ID029720,2021-04-15T13:22:02Z,NA,NA,NA,Got my first dose today!
25172,R3ID029726,2021-06-09T14:14:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it after reading all about it. I understand how vaccines work generally and knew it was the best option
25174,R3ID029726,2021-07-07T08:06:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated and so is my husband. From what I've read, it's as safe as most vaccines but the long-term effectiveness is still being tested and observed"
25176,R3ID029726,2021-10-13T08:07:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m fully vaccinated. I will get a booster when available
25177,R3ID029726,2021-11-10T10:17:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective with minimal side effects
25178,R3ID029726,2021-12-08T12:01:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Husband and I are vaxxed and boosted. My 6yo is fully vaxxed now too. Side effects are mild and not nearly as significant as Covid
25184,R3ID029729,2021-07-07T15:44:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as possible and feel very confident in its safety and effectiveness
25189,R3ID029729,2021-10-14T17:22:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and extremely effective at what it?s meant to do and also very effective at preventing disease even though not perfect at all. I got the shot as soon as I could and recently got the booster too.
25194,R3ID029736,2021-07-08T08:32:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"Fully vaccinated, I stand behind science"
25197,R3ID029736,2021-11-10T09:44:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very safe, I side with science, I trust my doctors and scientists and will get all vaccines when eligible for my children. Me and my husband are already vaccinated and will get booster soon."
25198,R3ID029741,2021-07-07T13:01:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it is effective, mostly safe , but get concerned about giving to my child"
25207,R3ID029746,2021-05-12T10:17:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safer to get the vaccine than not at all; have already received both doses myself
25212,R3ID029751,2021-07-09T08:05:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm all for it. My husband and I have had ours and we're ready for our children to get theirs too.
25219,R3ID029766,2021-04-14T09:58:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am getting the vaccine. I think it's better for everyone if we work on getting it to strengthen immunity. I think it's safe, and any amount of effectiveness is good.."
25221,R3ID029766,2021-10-13T10:27:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, I think it's mostly effective, but I'm still very cautious."
25222,R3ID029766,2021-12-08T09:02:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it. I think it's a good way to slow down the spread and maybe give milder symptoms. But I don't know about continuously getting booster shots. I probably will soon, but I'm not looking forward to it."
25227,R3ID029797,2021-06-09T09:03:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Fine
25228,R3ID029797,2021-07-07T11:05:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it's safe and I've already gotten both doses.
25230,R3ID029797,2021-09-15T15:32:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already received it
25232,R3ID029797,2021-10-13T10:51:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received it
25234,R3ID029799,2021-07-09T17:36:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Get it!!!
25235,R3ID029799,2021-09-15T08:39:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it three times! I?m immunocompromised
25239,R3ID029803,2021-05-12T14:23:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I trust in it fully and believe any small risks are less than the risks of getting or spreading covid.
25240,R3ID029803,2021-06-10T08:28:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it!
25241,R3ID029803,2021-07-07T16:06:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I am very comfortable with it's level of safety and thrilled to see that it continues to be effective against emerging variants.
25250,R3ID029812,2021-03-18T14:06:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it. I work in clinical research and this has terrific safety data.
25253,R3ID029813,2021-04-14T07:52:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received it-J&J
25254,R3ID029813,2021-06-10T08:14:32Z,NA,NA,NA,We have already received it
25256,R3ID029813,2021-12-09T13:48:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I've had the vaccine and booster. I feel they are safe and effective. I know breakthrough case will occur. I have immediate family on my husband's side who refuse to get it and we struggle with having contact with them because of safety concerns since our son isn't eligible for a vaccine yet. It's also put a strain on my in-laws seeing those grandchildren.
25258,R3ID029816,2021-03-18T22:46:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Great. Already got my first Pfizer.
25260,R3ID029816,2021-04-14T19:33:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s safe and have already gotten both Pfizer doses
25268,R3ID029821,2021-09-16T23:07:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, but will not get booster because of side effects"
25269,R3ID029821,2021-10-16T12:41:18Z,NA,NA,NA,It doesn?t work anymore
25271,R3ID029821,2021-11-12T07:08:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it with severe side effects. I will not get the booster
25273,R3ID029823,2021-10-13T16:47:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it ever.
25277,R3ID029829,2021-07-07T09:08:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Do no plan to get it; wary about its effectiveness.
25283,R3ID029840,2021-05-13T09:04:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I both got both doses of Pfizer, and my twelve year old is getting her first dose this weekend."
25285,R3ID029846,2021-04-14T22:02:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and necessary. Husband and i have already received both doses
25288,R3ID029847,2021-03-17T09:51:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Very confident. I already got my first dose.
25291,R3ID029847,2021-09-17T14:51:31Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective. My husband and I are both fully vaccinated and we are eager for the vaccine to be available for our son.
25296,R3ID029854,2021-10-13T08:44:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
25298,R3ID029861,2021-03-18T12:07:50Z,NA,NA,NA,My child and I will not get the vaccine due to extreme allergies and my sister that got the vaccine had an allergic reaction to the second shot
25305,R3ID029868,2021-12-10T14:37:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in science and follow my doctor's advice. The vaccines are safe and effective. My husband and I have received 3 shots each. Our son is in a Moderna trial and has received 2 shots (not sure if he has received the vaccine or placebo).
25308,R3ID029872,2021-06-09T09:56:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am deeply concerned that so many people are getting the vax (especially for their children) without long-term studies. Short term safety studies do not assure me. I need long term safety data (as we have for all other vaccines) before I will get this, or have my children vaccinated. These Covid vaxes are still in experimental trials until 2023 and the vaccine manufacturers are not liable for any damages. This concerns me greatly. I am youngish, healthy & not at risk for serious repercussions if I catch Covid & would prefer to take my chances in catching it & letting my immune system fight naturally. In 5-10 years after long term studies show both safety & effectiveness, then I may reconsider."
25311,R3ID029872,2021-10-15T12:17:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is proving to be ineffective, long term safety risks are unknown, and I am against the coercive nature of the vaccine mandates. I WILL NOT be getting the covid vax for either myself or my kids."
25317,R3ID029875,2021-05-12T08:56:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received
25323,R3ID029876,2021-06-09T13:52:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"Waiting for it to be it longer and see the long term effects it has. There are no long term studies, since it's so new."
25329,R3ID031289,2021-10-13T09:14:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I still have questions about why it is being so highly politicized. To my knowledge this hasn't happened with any other vaccine in my lifetime. I got it because it is required for my work (despite only working once per month). I feel thag it will have about the same effectiveness as the flu shot.
25330,R3ID031289,2021-11-10T09:40:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it because it was required. I feel that it will be similar to the flu shot in effectiveness. By that I mean that it's all just a guess as to which mutations the virus will make and we will end up needing yearly boosters which may or may not actually help. I'm not opposed to vaccines at all, I just think it is silly to vaccinate against colds which for the majority of the population pass without much ado."
25336,R3ID031292,2021-09-15T09:31:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
25338,R3ID031292,2021-11-10T09:18:19Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it. Waiting for my small kids to be able to get it
25339,R3ID031293,2021-06-09T17:14:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I consider myself as a person who believes in science. therefore, I believe in the vaccine, I have already recieved my two shots, and I hope that when the vaccines are available for children, I could vaccinate mine."
25344,R3ID031295,2021-04-14T09:07:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is amazing!  My husband and I have already recieved the first dose and will get it for our kids as soon as it is available
25351,R3ID031297,2021-04-14T07:09:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Not convinced about the effectiveness. I do not plan on getting it and neither will my family.
25353,R3ID031297,2021-06-09T09:30:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel like it's ineffective like the flu shot. And I don't plan on getting it
25355,R3ID031297,2021-07-07T08:41:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think there is enough research about the safety and effectiveness as there is with other vacciness. We collectively as a family will not be getting it.
25362,R3ID031301,2021-03-17T08:46:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it already. It is safe, efficient and the only way to get back to normal"
25364,R3ID031302,2021-03-17T19:27:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's too early to tell how safe it is, and I dont plan to get it now because as far as i know, trials are still going on to test how it affects reproductive health."
25369,R3ID031303,2021-07-07T09:01:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it as soon as it was available (March 2021) as did my partner (May 2021). We plan to vaccinate our daughter as soon as it is available for children. We had tried enrolling her in a trial, but there were none in the area."
25370,R3ID031303,2021-09-16T08:54:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already and plan to vaccinate my daughter as soon as it is approved for her age group
25371,R3ID031303,2021-10-13T08:29:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it as soon as it was available (March 2021) as did my partner. We will get our daughter vaccinated as soon as it is approved in the USA. My partner is Chilean and Chile already approved vaccines for 5+ so if we do our yearly trip there this year, we may get her vaccinated while there."

25382,R3ID031313,2021-04-16T12:28:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"Still unsure about getting the vaccine, as I am not convinced that they did adequate testing and know what the long term effects of the vaccine, if any. Also, the negative news and safety concerns regarding the Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccine and the corresponding ""pause"" does not surprise me at all"
25385,R3ID031314,2021-07-08T16:54:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the first shot and then got very sick so I did not get the second Pfizer shot.
25389,R3ID031314,2021-09-16T13:14:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the first shot and did not feel so good d I have delayed getting the second shot.

25417,R3ID029907,2021-12-08T12:37:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it's too soon to say for certain it is effective, they didn't have a long enough trial before trying to push everyone to take it therefore I nor my kids will be getting it any time soon."
25419,R3ID029909,2021-07-07T16:08:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I think its a good thing.

25463,R3ID029946,2021-05-13T12:58:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"Our family plans to wait a year or two before getting the vaccine. We are still careful in public, but have chosen to remain part of the control group due to lack of results/time tested with the covid vaccine. We are supportive of those who choose the vaccine- we just aren't positive it's the best route for our immediate family just yet."

25539,R3ID030042,2021-06-10T14:23:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not believe there is enough research to get the shot
25540,R3ID030042,2021-07-07T14:47:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine because I work in healthcare. I do not believe it is safe enough for children yet.
25541,R3ID030042,2021-09-15T10:44:26Z,NA,NA,NA,My fiancé and I have received it to aid with work requirements. I believe it?s effective in reducing the severity of symptoms but i think it is still to early to tell if it slows the spread.
25550,R3ID030057,2021-04-14T16:50:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve had one of my two doses of the vaccine

25570,R3ID030073,2021-09-15T08:55:21Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s not very protective but that?s to be expected it?s new
25572,R3ID030073,2021-12-08T09:29:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it and I?m glad that it cuts back the severity of effects that COVID has on the body

25597,R3ID030144,2021-12-09T06:31:25Z,NA,NA,NA,It is as safe as any can be. I am fully vaccinated and boosted. I plan to vaccinate my 5 yr old as soon as he is able. (Currently under exposure quarentine from school.)
25602,R3ID030152,2021-11-10T11:29:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the Pfizer vaccine when it became available last year and it gave me peace of mind that if I did indeed contract COVID I would be protected from serious illness or death.
25605,R3ID030160,2021-04-15T14:52:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I can't wait to get one...it literally cannot come soon enough. I've been trying to get waste doses bit so far haven't been lucky. My first scheduled dose is this month.

Technically he already has the antibodies because I lactate and have allowed him to continue having breast milk every morning and night. Including since receiving my vaccination.
25662,R3ID031338,2021-07-09T10:56:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m vaccinated but am not surprised that it?s still uncertain as to the effectiveness over the long term or that it has potential to damage some individuals.

25674,R3ID031340,2021-11-15T10:53:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it's safe enough, especially now, for it to become mandatory just like every other vaccine we are mandated to get as children and for our children to go to school. I think it has substantially saved millions of people and will continue to do so in the future. I already got my Pfizer vaccine."
25676,R3ID031341,2021-03-17T09:37:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. My husband and I have already gotten the vaccine.

It is easy to get for me and most of the people I interact with have gotten it. I guess I have some hesitations because it is a new vaccine and I recently I have seen that it hasn't proven to be as successful as once thought. The vaccine is being qusstioned now about its effectiveness long term or sometimes if it's effective at all.
25745,R3ID030247,2021-12-09T18:26:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I have not gotten it for myself or my child. My husband was mandated by his employer to ge the vaccine. I would not give my child the vaccination and I have not been reluctant about getting myself until recently.

25753,R3ID030252,2021-07-07T10:02:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I think It is effective. High risk population that has received it has been able to stay out of the hospital which is great. I?m still unsure about why I need It. I was More open to the idea before the government started getting so pushy about it. I?d like to see long term effects

26138,R3ID030537,2021-05-12T09:50:02Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure
26139,R3ID030537,2021-06-09T09:52:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Still on the fence
26157,R3ID030777,2021-07-07T12:42:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Scared to get it
26161,R3ID030783,2021-03-19T14:02:53Z,NA,NA,NA,Im still a little unsure about the vaccine. I've heard of people getting sick or dying from it but I understand that its a very small number. I still haven't decided.
26162,R3ID030783,2021-04-14T10:41:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Im still a little unsure but I will most likely get the vaccine when it is available to me.
26164,R3ID030783,2021-10-13T09:18:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Im still a little unsure how I feel about it but I will get it when I go to the doctor next
26165,R3ID030783,2021-12-08T08:59:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I was skeptical at first and still do hesitate a bit to get it but I do plan to get it eventually.

26175,R3ID030806,2021-04-14T07:22:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in science. I'm already vaccinated
26176,R3ID030806,2021-05-12T11:06:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in the effectiveness of the vaccine

26204,R3ID030866,2021-05-12T11:03:33Z,NA,NA,NA,have already recieved it. I feel its safe and neccessary
26208,R3ID030874,2021-04-14T08:16:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I was relieved to be vaccinated since I work in a school setting and we have had in-person learning for the whole academic year. I am still hesitant about the effectiveness of the vaccine (I received Pfizer) and its ability to protect me from the other COVID strains. I am also curious if I will need a booster in the next few tears
26210,R3ID030874,2021-05-12T11:00:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I will probably wait until my children are in school and around other children to get them the vaccine. they are currently at home everyday.
26211,R3ID030887,2021-03-18T03:27:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like there has not been any studies to know the long term effects of the vaccine so I will not be getting it and neither will my children

26216,R3ID030904,2021-05-12T12:44:12Z,NA,NA,NA,At this time I will not be getting the vaccine for me or my children. I do not feel safe getting it without more information about it?s long term effects and side effects like blood clots etc

26258,R3ID030913,2021-11-10T12:02:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"i am supportive of the vaccine, and got it because i am an essential healthcare worker at the beginning of it's availability. my oldest son just qualified as he's 5, but we have not yet gotten this due to scheduling and a bit of anxiety about it."
26260,R3ID030913,2021-12-08T14:47:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel safe as my state lacks precautions. Stores and businesses can require masks but people rarely follow. I prefer masking. I and my family members who are able are vaccinated. I use sanitizer religiously
26262,R3ID030919,2021-12-14T14:31:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and I'm vaccinated.

26291,R3ID030952,2021-03-17T10:03:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident that it is safe and effective
26292,R3ID030952,2021-05-14T15:08:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, I have some reservations about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. All eligible household members are currently vaccinated and we hope Pfizer will run trials for children below the age of 12"
26293,R3ID030952,2021-07-07T11:28:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Mostly confident regarding the vaccine. All eligible immediate and extended family members have obtained the vaccine
26298,R3ID030960,2021-12-09T16:49:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident that it?s our best protection right now. I?m vaccinated and plan to get the booster in the coming week.
26304,R3ID030965,2021-03-17T13:13:58Z,NA,NA,NA,We'll all get it as soon as we're able. I feel like it is safe and well tested. The benefits outweigh the risks.
26305,R3ID030965,2021-07-08T15:56:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I and my husband have both got them. We generally are very pro-vaccine. Our kids will get Covid vaccines when they are able.
26310,R3ID030970,2021-03-17T22:27:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not safe as shown by many reported adverse reactions on VAERS, and questionable as to whether it's effective due to the fact that it doesn't stop transmission, only lessens symptoms and most people have mild to no symptoms, so making it any more effective than that would turn people into asymptomatic carriers."
26312,R3ID030970,2021-10-15T21:24:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's neither safe (for all), nor effective (in many cases), will never get it because covid is not a high risk disease."
26315,R3ID030974,2021-11-12T09:33:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"Have been vaccinated, will not get a booster and will not vaccinate my child. I don?t like the government telling me I HAVE to do something with mine or my child?s body just to ?have fun again?"
26319,R3ID030976,2021-11-14T12:39:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerned about effectiveness as we await our test results of a possible break through case.  We support the vaccine

26340,R3ID030982,2021-03-19T13:21:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust science and hope to get the vaccine when it's offered to us.
26341,R3ID030982,2021-05-12T10:51:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm still waiting to decide what the best vaccine is, the risks."
26342,R3ID030986,2021-06-11T15:02:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Very confident in safety and effictiveness
26344,R3ID030986,2021-12-08T22:04:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective I have gotten it and my child will when it is available for his age.
26348,R3ID030993,2021-03-17T19:32:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the vaccination is both unsafe and illogical. I would not ever consider getting the vaccine nor having my children vaccinated. We have immune systems.
26352,R3ID030993,2021-07-09T17:29:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I know it is not safe nor ""effective"" (at anything other than causing harm) and not one individual in my entire family would ever consider getting it nor any other vaccine"
26360,R3ID031004,2021-03-18T18:40:22Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and I?ll get it when I?m eligible
26362,R3ID031004,2021-04-14T21:20:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get it as soon as possible.
26364,R3ID031004,2021-05-13T18:56:19Z,NA,NA,NA,Already had first dose. More safe to get vaccine than to not get it.
26370,R3ID031008,2021-04-15T00:04:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure if I?m getting it
26371,R3ID031008,2021-06-09T21:20:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not sure about safety, feel forced into getting it"
26373,R3ID031008,2021-09-16T00:54:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it but not sure if it?s safety
26375,R3ID031011,2021-04-14T09:02:19Z,NA,NA,6,"I'm indifferent about it - in its safety, effectiveness and receiving it. I'm currently pregnant and will NOT be receiving it while I'm with child. Not sure I will receive it right away.. I did have COVID-19 in the fall."
26378,R3ID031013,2021-04-14T10:21:08Z,NA,NA,NA,we actually got our 1st shots this week and we feel it's safe for us. I have seen good effectiveness with my family.
26382,R3ID031014,2021-04-15T13:17:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Trusting but slightly nervous. Planned to get it as soon as possible.
26383,R3ID031014,2021-07-07T10:01:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been vaccinated.
26387,R3ID031023,2021-11-15T20:55:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Keep washing hands and wear mask in public
26391,R3ID031037,2021-05-12T12:37:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe that it's not safe for people yet. We rushed into getting one that a lot of steps were missing in order to provide a safe and affective vaccine. I have heard the stories and experiences coworkers, family and friends have told me about it. I feel we have not been told the whole truth about COVID, nor the ""vaccine"". So, until it has been out for a few years, we know the side affects, risks, and what it actually does to our bodies, I do not want myself or my daughter to receive it."
26395,R3ID031037,2021-11-12T11:12:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not feel it is safe or effective. If you really look at the big picture, the Government is pushing the vaccine too much and pointing fingers to scare citizens into something they might not want to do. The government is making threats, bribing, forcing, and more just to get their vaccine out... that is a BIG red flag to me."
26396,R3ID031037,2021-12-08T10:56:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"Never getting it. Why get a ""vaccine"" if it doesn't ensure you won't get it again. Even if you're fully vaccinated, you can still get COVID... it's a waste."
26397,R3ID031038,2021-06-09T08:41:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, my oldest get to choose, and my youngest isint eligible yet"
26401,R3ID031040,2021-03-18T21:22:00Z,NA,NA,6,I feel like it is the way back to normal and i hope to get it soon
26402,R3ID031040,2021-04-14T07:43:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the phizer and moderna ones are good and necessary, but more skeptical about johnson. I have my first shot of phizer"
26406,R3ID031044,2021-07-09T08:15:46Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure yet. I would like to see more testing before i let my child get it
26407,R3ID031044,2021-11-10T19:45:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel comfortable with it for adults. I am more wary of it for kids and think people need to talk with their doctor before making decisions.
26411,R3ID031047,2021-05-12T07:05:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am still unsure as it hasn't been out long. Being pregnant, I am currently not planning to get the vaccine."
26414,R3ID031047,2021-09-15T09:05:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to get it until it has been around longer and there has been some study on the long term effects.
26417,R3ID031047,2021-11-11T10:41:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I would compare the COVID vaccine as more similar to the flu shot than other vaccines currently available. Most people I know of that have gotten covid recently are vaccinated. It may be effective to a degree but it's not as effective as it is being made put to be. I think it is to new to judge what the long term safety is. I may get the vaccine in the future but my plans right now are to not get it.
26418,R3ID031047,2021-12-14T14:35:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Most of the people I have known to get COVID lately have been vaccinated which does make me question the vaccines effectiveness. As far as safety I am nervous because their hasn't been enough time to determine any negative effects from the vaccine. Currently I am not planning to get the vaccine until a future date.
26419,R3ID031049,2021-03-17T09:54:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get.
26422,R3ID031049,2021-10-13T08:33:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"It was developed too quickly, and I will not be getting it."
26423,R3ID031051,2021-04-15T13:42:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m in the middle. Wish we knew how long it lasted
26424,R3ID031051,2021-11-14T14:19:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I received mine in April. I feel it?s safe
26434,R3ID031070,2021-04-15T06:42:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm very unsure about getting a vaccine. Especially after what came out in the news about the blood clots.
26436,R3ID031074,2021-11-10T09:33:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think enough research has been done andy family does not want to recieved it
26442,R3ID031092,2021-05-12T10:12:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Have it! Encourage others to also.
26445,R3ID031092,2021-12-08T17:24:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"There's always risk and that does concern me, but I believe that it has been tested and is safe. I received the vaccine very early and convinced other family members to get it as well."
26448,R3ID031096,2021-05-12T10:19:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Still undecided
26458,R3ID031113,2021-10-14T14:37:45Z,NA,NA,NA,everyone eligible in my family has gotten it and I cannot wait for it to be approved for young children.
26460,R3ID031113,2021-11-11T12:26:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust the science. My partner and I are going to get the booster soon and I cannot wait for it to become available for children under 5
26462,R3ID031114,2021-03-17T08:56:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I  very hesitant about the vaccine
26463,R3ID031114,2021-04-14T10:59:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not be getting the vaccine. I plan to become pregnant in the next year and do not trust the vaccine.

26466,R3ID031114,2021-06-09T17:29:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not be getting it as I don?t fully trust it (and I?m pregnant)
26468,R3ID031114,2021-07-07T09:02:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I am pregnant and do not trust the safety of it at this time.
26472,R3ID031114,2021-09-15T12:49:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust it at this time and feel the FDA approval was WAY too rushed.
26485,R3ID031126,2021-04-14T08:47:25Z,NA,NA,5,Not safe right not. Waiting to see which will be best to get because I have an autoimmune disease
26487,R3ID031130,2021-06-11T13:50:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Myself (pregnant) and husband are fully vaccinated; feel the safety/unknowns of the vaccine are much safer than the known issues associated with COVID-19
26492,R3ID031133,2021-09-17T08:11:03Z,NA,NA,NA,everyone in my family has received the vaccine except the kids. i believe it is necessary and effective and everyone should be made to get it
26495,R3ID031136,2021-07-09T14:28:52Z,NA,NA,6,"1. This vaccine is injecting us with spike proteins that will help our human body recognize the Coronavirus and attack it, will it recognize all strands of the coronaviruses?  He said Yes!    2.  Our body naturally fights off viruses.  The human body naturally attacks viruses, however being injected with an mRNA, that the body is attacking something producing, wouldn't that be harmful and cause long-term complications?  He was not sure.    3.  Would this affect our autoimmune system?  He was not sure!   4.)How do you know if it does affect our autoimmune system or not?    He was not sure!   5. What statistics do they have on this?   He was not sure!   6.  Is it true that 99% of people that were affected by Covid recovered?  He said he believes that information is false but really could not back up his beliefs.    7.  If 99% of people recovered from the Coronavirus, which takes 2 to 3 weeks to get over, Why should I take a vaccine that can give me an autoimmune disease that will last a lifetime?  He said it was totally my preference and a risk that I'm taking.  However, either way, I'm taking a risk by taking this vaccine or not.    8.  Does Quercetin help in preventing the Corona Virus?  He has not heard of it.    9.  Does Pine Pollen help in preventing the Corona Virus?  He has not heard of it."

26569,R3ID031431,2021-12-08T15:14:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not too trusting of the current vaccines available. I do not plan on getting any of them and nobody can convince me that they are safe.
26573,R3ID031433,2021-09-16T08:02:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe that the vaccine works and is incredibly safe. I have already gotten the vaccine.

26584,R3ID031441,2021-11-10T14:06:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe. I got it and once my kids qualify they will get it too.
26589,R3ID031446,2021-12-08T11:16:13Z,NA,NA,NA,My family members over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated.  My younger children I feel comfortable waiting.
26593,R3ID031447,2021-03-17T20:23:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I have some concerns about its safety. I'm not yet sure if I'll get it. I'm worried about the risks considering I have ITP. I need to look into it more before I make a decision.
26595,R3ID031447,2021-06-09T09:35:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Seems safe and very effective for the average person. I am unsure about whether I will get it.
26596,R3ID031447,2021-07-07T09:08:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"Seems safe & effective for the vast majority of people. I will probably not get the vaccine myself, but the rest of my family probably will."
26598,R3ID031447,2021-09-15T10:45:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Seems safe & effective for most people. Probably will not get it due to a medical condition.

26620,R3ID031463,2021-05-12T08:08:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it.  I feel very confident in its safety and effectiveness.
26622,R3ID031463,2021-11-10T11:58:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe.  Everyone should get it. My whole family is vaccinated.  My 3 kids were all in vaccine trials.
26624,R3ID031463,2021-12-08T08:36:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe. Already vaccinated x 3 and all my kids are vaccinated through trials
26627,R3ID031464,2021-07-08T05:50:06Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s safe but comes with risks and side effects
26631,R3ID031464,2021-11-10T20:01:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"It?s not very effective and safe, but it does help. I Still prefer to have mask mandated. I got two shots, and I?m planning on getting booster shot"
26633,R3ID031464,2021-12-09T14:35:44Z,NA,NA,NA,It does have risks but it?s safer to take Covid-19 vaccines

26648,R3ID031475,2021-03-17T09:18:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not going to get vaccinated
26649,R3ID031475,2021-04-14T07:09:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not want the MRNA vaccination as the side effects are unknown to me at this point and it's newer technology.  I'd consider getting the J&J vaccine but also don't feel like I need it.
26654,R3ID031487,2021-10-13T14:14:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it including the booster. I think it is highly beneficial
26658,R3ID031490,2021-09-15T12:21:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like even though we don't know much about it they are safer than getting sick with the virus.
26661,R3ID031495,2021-10-13T19:15:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I have both vaccines and plan on getting the booster
26662,R3ID031498,2021-05-12T09:35:48Z,NA,NA,NA,A little hesitant but I got it.
26665,R3ID031498,2021-11-13T12:35:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it. I'm still unsure about whether or not my young children will get it. There is always a risk when getting a vaccine, but usually the benefits outweigh the risks. I am hesitant about this one because I would prefer to see long term effects."
26666,R3ID031502,2021-05-12T10:02:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"We are wary, but my spouse and I got it."
26668,R3ID031502,2021-09-17T09:51:21Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I received both Pzifer vaccines. We are cautious but resigned to it.
26670,R3ID031502,2021-10-13T10:19:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Neutral. I recieved the vaccine.
26673,R3ID031513,2021-04-14T13:21:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it?s safe or effective I don?t trust it

26678,R3ID031513,2021-12-08T09:44:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Hesitant
26687,R3ID031524,2021-10-13T18:43:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Definitely not effective and by the way the government is pushing it I don?t think it?s safe
26689,R3ID031526,2021-05-12T08:20:01Z,NA,NA,NA,already received
26694,R3ID031530,2021-07-08T14:25:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I still do not think there is enough data to make a truly informed decision about taking it.
26699,R3ID031532,2021-03-17T09:06:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I am 100% supportive of the vaccine!
26701,R3ID031532,2021-05-13T14:11:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received and will get my children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.
26702,R3ID031532,2021-07-09T08:18:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"No concerns, already received (as soon as I could!)"
26704,R3ID031532,2021-10-13T08:09:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine.
26712,R3ID031543,2021-03-18T10:25:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure about it and do not want it at this time

26715,R3ID031543,2021-05-14T13:08:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe yet and Not getting it
26724,R3ID031543,2021-11-12T07:11:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure about safety and effectiveness but I feel like to have a decent job it is now a requirement
26725,R3ID031543,2021-12-10T07:08:07Z,NA,NA,NA,It is required for job security
26732,R3ID031552,2021-10-13T09:21:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it but I understand why some people may be hesitant but I do not understand the people who are blatantly against it and wont listen to reason
26733,R3ID031552,2021-11-11T11:12:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"Its unusual because with other vaccines it seems completely normal to receive them. I'm not a vaccine skeptic but this one, likely because of all the propaganda against it seems like a more difficult choice to receive when it comes to my children. I received it but my 10 year old could get it now and I haven't even really thought about it yet."
26737,R3ID031558,2021-09-15T09:11:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"Have gotten it, no significant concerns about safety"
26738,R3ID031567,2021-05-14T13:07:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is safe and effective, but I?m waiting until i?m in the third trimester of my pregnancy to get the shot."
26742,R3ID031567,2021-09-15T21:29:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got the vaccine. I waited until I reached my third trimester to try to pass some of the antibodies onto the baby.
26744,R3ID031567,2021-12-08T12:22:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have the Pfizer vaccine and I plan to get a booster six months from the time I receive the vaccine. I waited until I was 36 months pregnant so I could try to pass on some antibodies to the baby
26745,R3ID031573,2021-06-09T09:52:24Z,NA,NA,3,I don?t feel safe at all about it and will not be getting it.
26751,R3ID031579,2021-05-13T21:35:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Not so sure about it
26754,R3ID031579,2021-07-07T14:24:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Still waiting for more information
26762,R3ID031584,2021-12-12T08:09:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"My family will not be getting the vaccine in the near future. I question it's short term and long term effects on our health. I also question how effective it really is. My mother got the vaccine and the optional booster then contracted covid and was very sick. Same case for at least 6+ other people I know. From my understanding, the vaccine doesn't effect the rate of transmission, so I think that the only reason mandates are in place is to lessen the amount of money the local and federal governments have to spend on managing covid cases, as well as reducing the over flooding of hospitals. I also question the long term effectiveness as covid strains mutate. There is every chance that the next mutation will not be effected by the current vaccine which would create a new wave of new vaccine mandates and protocols. The cycle could continue, creating the same system we see in flu shots. They offer a vaccine protecting against a different variation every year, which is rarely ever effective. Then people are constantly flooding their bodies with tons of ingredients that can be harmful in the short and long term. In addition to those concerns, I also worry that since the covid vaccine doesn't effect transmission but reduces the likelihood of experiencing symptoms, it's creating an army of asymptomatic carriers. We're seeing the same type of spikes in infection rates as we were when elementary schools were reopened. In that case, since children are much more likely to be infected without showing symptoms, elementary students would often be asymptomatic carriers and attend school as usual. They would pass it to their fellow students who would pass it to their parents, then their parents would unknowingly expose people to the virus before their own symptoms started. I think the vaccine game is a dangerous one, and this vaccine is going the same route as the aids vaccine. The only question to me is ""How much chaos and damage will it do before it's finally stopped?""."
26764,R3ID031589,2021-12-14T13:43:15Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure I terms of effectiveness. Planning to get booster.
26765,R3ID031599,2021-03-19T13:52:12Z,NA,NA,NA,wait and see; concerned it has been rushed to market
26766,R3ID031599,2021-07-07T09:02:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Already have it but unsure of of the safety of it. Im concerned it was rushed to market and hasn't been properly vetted.
26774,R3ID031602,2021-09-16T08:41:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure. I am vaccinated.

26782,R3ID031611,2021-04-14T15:19:37Z,NA,NA,NA,Do not think it is safe yet and do not plan to get it.
26783,R3ID031611,2021-10-13T20:09:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't feel it is especially safe or effective right now. It hasn't been studied for long term effects.
26784,R3ID031611,2021-11-10T16:11:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't know if it's actually safe. We are worried to get it because long term effects haven't been studied and there have been issues with it.
26786,R3ID031618,2021-04-14T22:44:29Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I just gotten our 2nd dose. We wanted it to protect our child and family.

26790,R3ID031622,2021-04-14T15:38:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe. I still worry about side effects but will get the shot.

26804,R3ID031634,2021-03-17T22:51:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am uncertain about it. I feel like I would get it when it becomes available to me, but I am still nervous about whether or not there might be long term effects. I would feel more confident if my doctor recommended it to me and assured me it was safe. It is difficult to trust the media or the government because they are distant entities. But, my regular physician knows me and I would trust her to have my best interest in mind."
26805,R3ID031634,2021-04-14T13:10:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scheduled to get it.

26824,R3ID031652,2021-03-17T12:17:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"My family will not get it.  There are no studies showing long term safety.  MRNA is a new method of ""vaccination"" with no long term studies to show safety."
26826,R3ID031652,2021-05-14T15:44:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"Because it is a new vaccine (some using new methods- eg mrna) with unknown safety and effectiveness, especially in the long term, and because the death rate for COVID is very low, especially among younger people, we will not get the vaccine.  The risks outweigh the benefits."

If we were to travel out of country for any reason, i might research and decide on certain particular vaccines. But as of now, i plan to never again vaccinate, based on research of vaccine effectiveness/side effects/injuries and based on where/who vaccine profits go to. I definitely will not be gwtting the covid vaccine. Im not sure i want to be around others who have been vaccinated till i can research that more since the vaccine may be being used as a bioweapon. But i doubt i will have a choice to not be around vaccinated people as so many are opting to get it."

I do not believe it is safe or effectove or necessary. I am waiting till i am done breastfeeding to take a natural supplement that helps remove toxins from ypur body that are a result of vaccines. I may also do a few other things to detox from heavy metals like a bentonite clay bath. I just dont have bentonite clay on hand. So i havent done it yet because i need to go get some.
26844,R3ID031662,2021-11-10T09:51:28Z,NA,NA,NA,We wont get it. I dont think It's safe or effective. Natural immunity is best.
26846,R3ID031663,2021-06-09T10:24:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received it. I am confident that it is quite effective. I think it?s probably pretty safe for most people but I know a small group of people can have severe effects and we have no way of knowing the long-term effects
26850,R3ID031669,2021-05-12T16:37:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it and it?s fine
26853,R3ID031669,2021-12-13T14:34:31Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s effective. I know several cases personally where Covid was diagnosed in close contacts but those vaccinated did not get it. I don?t know anyone with bad side effects. I have it and got my booster today.
26865,R3ID031686,2021-07-08T18:35:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I did not have much hesitation.
26868,R3ID031686,2021-09-15T13:17:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. No hesitations at all. I believe in science.
26872,R3ID031691,2021-03-17T12:12:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I am pro-vaccine. I have already gotten my first dose.
26873,R3ID031691,2021-04-15T11:35:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in Science and believe that it is effective. I already got vaccinated.
26874,R3ID031691,2021-05-13T20:12:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I completely believe in it and I am already fully vaccinated.
26875,R3ID031691,2021-06-09T22:09:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is effective and safe. I am fully vaccinated.
26878,R3ID031691,2021-12-08T22:48:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in science and believe that it is safe and effective. I am fully vaccinated and had the booster.
26882,R3ID031700,2021-03-17T15:19:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and I plan to get it as soon as I am eligible.
26885,R3ID031700,2021-10-17T13:00:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I am already vaccinated. I trust the science.
26887,R3ID031703,2021-06-09T12:02:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I have no plans to get it. There have not been enough studies or long term studies.
26888,R3ID031703,2021-11-12T09:18:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I have no intention of getting it for my children. Ever. I hot it only after meeting with several doctors whom I trust personally. I don't believe I actually needed it because I was tested and had a Hugh number of anti bodies 11 months post my COVID diagnosis
26893,R3ID031705,2021-04-14T09:41:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it and it's still in clinical trials. So those taking it are Lab rats. And why get a shot for something that is not deadly. Don't take flu shot won't take covid shot
26897,R3ID031705,2021-10-13T13:48:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Definitely not getting it for myself or anyone in my family. There is not enough data or research on the vaccine. Not to mention mRna in the vaccine sending spiked proteins to your cells with no known stop date.
26901,R3ID032020,2021-05-12T10:35:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I am still unsure about the vaccine and have no intention of taking it at the moment.
26913,R3ID032027,2021-09-15T09:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it?s better alternative rather than getting COVID-19 without the vaccine. I weighed the options and better chance of surviving if taken vaccine. Also I listen to what the scientists and doctors say because that?s their expertise. I have received the vaccine.
26914,R3ID032027,2021-12-14T22:13:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I belive it is safe and effective and we have recevied both vaccination shots but have not recvied the booster

26923,R3ID032031,2021-10-14T08:36:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine, so I feel pretty sure about it."
26925,R3ID032036,2021-10-14T10:14:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"It?s complicated. I think those who are young, fit, and eat whole food diets should have the choice to get it or not. There is also not enough trust in it for those pregnant or nursing. It has messed with women?s menstrual cycles. I got one dose so far"
26926,R3ID032036,2021-11-10T10:51:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Conflicted. Not enough studies were done for those breastfeeding or pregnant. There is conflicting information on miscarriages associated with the vaccine. I have gotten one dose of Pfizer
26930,R3ID032037,2021-05-13T00:12:54Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe to use
26935,R3ID032037,2021-09-15T17:58:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Very much supporting vaccine. I am fully vaccinated
26938,R3ID032039,2021-06-11T08:07:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it, very confident in it"
26941,R3ID032039,2021-10-16T11:42:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Very comfortable with vaccine and eager to get booster

26960,R3ID032043,2021-05-12T08:52:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"We got it as soon as we could. It?s very safe, any side effects are very well tracked and can help us get back to normal life quicker."
26963,R3ID032043,2021-09-16T08:34:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it as soon as we could. No more side effects than any other vaccine and way safer than getting covid
26969,R3ID032045,2021-03-17T11:42:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"Undecided, concerned with clinical trial participants not being diverse."
26971,R3ID032045,2021-04-14T11:29:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
26973,R3ID032045,2021-05-12T08:57:38Z,NA,NA,NA,A lot of unknowns
26975,R3ID032045,2021-06-09T11:04:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received; feel it is like a flu vaccine but more studies needed
26977,R3ID032045,2021-07-08T10:18:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I feel there are still many unknowns
26982,R3ID032045,2021-09-16T10:05:03Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received it, but who knows how effective it is"
26984,R3ID032045,2021-10-14T14:17:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it offers some protection and I have already received it.
26986,R3ID032045,2021-11-10T12:20:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it. Not sure of safety, just taking my chances."
26988,R3ID032045,2021-12-08T18:45:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received it, but not 100% sure if the long term impact"
26993,R3ID032046,2021-04-14T07:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Wish they're wouldn't been me time to study any potential effects in the years to come
26998,R3ID032048,2021-03-18T11:32:14Z,NA,NA,NA,This vaccine has been tested for immediate health affects but no one knows if it will cause long term issues such as infertility.
26999,R3ID032048,2021-04-14T07:36:13Z,NA,NA,NA,It hasn?t been around long enough to know either answer.
27007,R3ID032049,2021-11-14T21:46:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is safe enough for general use, and it is the key to curbing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID19. I already have it and plan to get my child vaccinated as soon as possible. (He is 2)"
27015,R3ID032051,2021-11-10T10:02:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Not interested at this time
27016,R3ID032051,2021-12-08T09:13:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think it will help but I got it anyway.
27017,R3ID032052,2021-03-17T09:20:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it when it's available to the public
27020,R3ID032065,2021-06-09T22:52:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received the vaccine. I believe it is safe and effective in preventing serious illness and/or hospitalization
27021,R3ID032065,2021-07-07T09:03:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it. My spouse has not received it and is undecided if he will or won't.
27024,R3ID032065,2021-10-13T12:23:37Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I have already received the vaccine - we felt it was the best decision for us to make as we both have contact with many people at our jobs.
27026,R3ID032070,2021-04-14T18:11:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like they are mostly safe and do plan on getting one. I am slightly concerned just because they are so new but know that they went through vigorous trials
27027,R3ID032070,2021-07-08T13:39:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve already gotten it. I feel it?s fairly safe but with anything we don?t know the full effects because it is so new. I got it and it was rough but was better then getting Covid.
27029,R3ID032070,2021-09-17T13:57:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective and have already been immunized fully

27057,R3ID032084,2021-10-13T11:21:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I would prefer not to get the vaccine
27058,R3ID032084,2021-11-10T11:11:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I just don't know...im very confused with the whole vaccine or natural immunity thing
27060,R3ID032084,2021-12-10T15:21:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I personally feel against the vaccine...the people, family members etc that have been vaccinated all have gotten I'll ...some got very I'll some didn't...being myself and my children have been infected in august...masks and sanitizing often will get us through..i pray"
27063,R3ID032086,2021-06-10T11:21:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have a stroke disorder, so I don't plan on getting it"
27065,R3ID032086,2021-07-08T09:16:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan on getting it but not any time soon
27069,R3ID032086,2021-11-11T05:09:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received my first Pfizer dose in September and my final dose in October. I'm happy I got it, despite not wanting it. I was mandated for my job. I do not plan on getting the booster. If I do, I will get another Pfizer"

27080,R3ID032097,2021-07-08T05:34:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm  not sure of its safety since it is still in the  trial phases.
27082,R3ID032097,2021-11-11T11:16:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Hopefully there are no long term effects from the vaccines. I am fully vaccinated.
27083,R3ID032097,2021-12-08T08:37:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I hope that there are no long term side affects related to taking the vaccine.  I am fully vaccinated.

27104,R3ID032114,2021-12-08T13:22:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I love that we have vaccines! My husband and I are fully vaccinated and have gotten the booster. My 5 and 6 year old children have gotten both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. I am just waiting for my 2 year old to be eligible (hopefully soon!)
27111,R3ID032137,2021-03-17T11:26:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I am on the waitlist to vaccinate right now
27114,R3ID032137,2021-06-09T11:06:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got vaccinated
27120,R3ID032137,2021-10-14T09:06:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I got vaccinated for my job requirements
27121,R3ID032137,2021-11-12T09:23:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it just for peace of mind not cause I actually believe in it just dint want to go get tested every week at work

27134,R3ID032138,2021-12-14T16:20:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"My whole family received all, including booster shots. Waiting for my 5 year old to get her second vaccine"
27143,R3ID032157,2021-04-15T12:08:13Z,NA,NA,NA,My family will not get it. We don't even get a flu shot. Don't want to inject the virus intous.

27148,R3ID032162,2021-03-17T12:50:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received my first dose. Yes, I worry that it will be effective long term and yes I have safety concerns. There is always a risk with a vaccine, but the risk of the disease a vaccine protects against is greater in my mind."
27155,R3ID032166,2021-12-08T11:36:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t trust it until I am able to hold the companies accountable without any loopholes should it cause severe problems. I can hold other pharmaceutical companies accountable for any damages done by any of their products including vaccinations. It is suspicious to me that the companies behind the Covid 19 vaccine have loop holes in their handouts to almost prevent any responsibility should it cause harm.
27162,R3ID032180,2021-03-17T08:55:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it because it is the right thing to do not just for myself but for others around me.

27164,R3ID032180,2021-05-12T08:38:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I think that it may be safer but that there could be unknown side effects. I will get it as soon as I can
27165,R3ID032180,2021-06-09T08:04:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s a. Preventive measure and I recently received my first shot of the vaccine
27167,R3ID032180,2021-07-07T09:25:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine but I understand us not a 100% effective
27171,R3ID032180,2021-09-17T09:18:38Z,NA,NA,NA,my husband and I got the vaccine already we understand is to help not get worse if we get infected

27175,R3ID032180,2021-11-10T09:49:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received the vaccine and I understand it is a preventive measure and masks should be worn in public. And people should quarantine or take a COVID test if they have symptoms
27177,R3ID032180,2021-12-09T10:24:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I think all should get vaccinated but I understand it is not a all cure. I have received the vaccine

27194,R3ID032194,2021-03-17T15:32:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm hopeful for dinner normalcy.
27197,R3ID032195,2021-05-13T00:31:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I am weary about getting it for my infant.

27666,R3ID032494,2021-09-15T09:49:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think its actual safety/effectiveness are irrelevant, God directs our lives. I have gotten the vaccine, because it doesn't matter and it isnt important for me to fight it."
27668,R3ID032494,2021-10-13T09:11:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think its effectiveness is irrelevant, I already have received it but I wouldn't be concerned if I hadn't."
27670,R3ID032494,2021-11-10T11:08:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the actual effectiveness of the vaccine is irrelevant to whether people will take it. I have already taken it.
27674,R3ID032498,2021-05-12T17:15:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Side effects
27676,R3ID032500,2021-04-15T16:12:24Z,NA,NA,3,Still unsure
27680,R3ID032501,2021-07-09T15:20:34Z,NA,NA,NA,My family will not be getting the poison.
27683,R3ID032504,2021-04-14T10:54:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Not entirely comfortable with it. But life must go on and for that to happen. We all need to be vaccinated
27684,R3ID032504,2021-05-12T08:41:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don?t trust it completely, feels like it was rushed because of the worlds situation. But if we ever want some sense of normalcy we got the vaccine."
27686,R3ID032504,2021-06-09T18:13:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"We have been vaccinated, we aren?t entirely confident about it. But if we want to travel and have things get back to normal. There really wasn?t a choice"
27689,R3ID032504,2021-09-15T13:31:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaccinated
27690,R3ID032504,2021-12-08T14:51:53Z,NA,NA,NA,We are anxious to get back to normal.
27695,R3ID032507,2021-05-13T00:39:29Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s a test and until there?s better research me or my family will not be getting the vaccine
27696,R3ID032507,2021-07-07T23:15:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it?s for absolute last resort necessary and hasn?t had enough science and I don?t plan to get it
27702,R3ID032511,2021-05-12T17:07:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Relieved to have the vaccine available and to know people in my circle who have it. Gladly received as soon as I could.
27703,R3ID032511,2021-07-07T11:46:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, I trust it. I want more research to be done before trusting my child to get it."
27705,R3ID032511,2021-12-08T13:02:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"Effective, safe. Got it, plan to get booster."
27706,R3ID032512,2021-03-17T21:11:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Will get the J&J
27707,R3ID032515,2021-06-09T09:33:08Z,NA,NA,3,I feel it is safe to get the vaccine. Although a number of people who have died some claim it is due to the vaccine i believe there were underlying conditions as to why they died. I feel it is effective because since people are starting to get vaccinated less cases have appeared.i already got my first dose I am waiting to get my second.
27708,R3ID032516,2021-03-17T17:25:04Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe. I got it.
27710,R3ID032516,2021-07-07T13:14:45Z,NA,NA,NA,It's safe. I've gotten it.
27720,R3ID032533,2021-04-15T13:24:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it
27725,R3ID032533,2021-09-16T15:04:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think that it works nor is it safe
27726,R3ID032533,2021-12-15T05:47:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is pointless and unsafe
27730,R3ID032537,2021-09-16T13:43:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received it, I believe it is helpful and responsible"
27731,R3ID032537,2021-11-10T09:07:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s the solution to everything that?s going on. I was a little nervous to get it at first but I?m glad I did. I believe it?s as safe as any other vaccine (a slight risk for some but safe for most)
27733,R3ID032537,2021-12-08T09:50:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is a great resource and as safe as any other vaccine. I have received the vaccine and plan to get the booster within the next week.
27743,R3ID032543,2021-10-13T08:04:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine to protect my children since they're not old enough to get it. As for effectiveness, I believe it'll reduce the risk of me getting covid but that doesn't eliminate the risk just as any other vaccine."
27744,R3ID032543,2021-11-15T15:24:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received both doses of the vaccine but I'm now skeptical of the booster. Maybe in the future I'll feel more confident in it. But as long as it has effectiveness to keep my kids safe who aren't old enough to get it, is all that matters."
27746,R3ID032543,2021-12-08T14:57:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I would hope the vaccine works to reduce the chance of getting covid but I'm unsure of the booster. I have gotten both doses but not the booster yet
27748,R3ID032546,2021-07-07T22:08:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel good about its safety and effectiveness, and have already received my vaccine"
27751,R3ID032546,2021-12-08T12:54:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received the vaccine and booster as soon as I was eligible. I am thankful for a way to help protect myself and my family and feel glad that it as effective and safe as it is, though disappointed to learn about waning efficacy"
27762,R3ID032551,2021-05-12T09:16:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel there isn?t enough research on the Covid 19 vaccine for me to feel safe or determined to get it. I have no plans on getting the shot.
27764,R3ID032551,2021-06-09T12:31:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am not in favor of the vaccine because it?s new, and people have had negative side effects, not including death"
27766,R3ID032551,2021-07-07T10:20:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont think its safe and i wont be getting it
27771,R3ID032551,2021-09-15T09:03:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m still uncertain, but I?m leaning more towards getting the vaccine"
27773,R3ID032551,2021-10-14T11:38:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I recently got the first dose and while I was apprehensive, ensuring that I don?t expose my kids is more important to me."
27775,R3ID032551,2021-11-12T08:29:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine to protect my children if I ever contracted Covid again. I'm still not 100% a fan of it.
27776,R3ID032551,2021-12-08T09:58:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I reluctantly got it after contracting covid but I still wear a mask. I'm not too keen on getting the booster.the side effects are overwhelming.
27778,R3ID032552,2021-07-09T16:58:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to wait a while to get it to see long term side effects. I will continue to follow safety guidelines before and after I receive my vaccine
27780,R3ID032552,2021-11-15T15:20:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Me and my spouse are fully vaccinated. We would like our children to also be fully vaccinated but are not ready to have them do so at this time, in fear as the vaccine has not been approved for very long. I would like to wait at least a year before having them take it, in Hope that research will be more accurate on longer-term side effects."
27786,R3ID032553,2021-09-17T11:03:11Z,NA,NA,NA,Me and my spouse got the vaccine already. I feel that everyone should be vaccinated but not that it should be mandatory
27787,R3ID032553,2021-10-16T13:22:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m sure it?s pretty safe. I got it
27794,R3ID032554,2021-03-18T22:04:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enoigh research. Will wait another year.
27796,R3ID032554,2021-04-16T16:47:30Z,NA,NA,NA,Still need to be researched. Family will not get it.
27798,R3ID032554,2021-05-12T22:26:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Still needs more research
27800,R3ID032554,2021-06-09T09:01:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enough research
27802,R3ID032554,2021-07-08T09:01:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Still needs to be studied
27807,R3ID032554,2021-09-15T13:37:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Need more research on effects of mothers who breastfeed and the first 5 years of child's life
27809,R3ID032554,2021-10-13T09:17:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Still deciding
27815,R3ID032568,2021-12-08T22:59:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like not enough research has been done. My client is immune compromised so I?m being pressured to get it but I am scared and do not want it.
27824,R3ID032582,2021-03-17T09:24:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am getting my second dose today and husband got his last week. We will get our daughter?s when it is available. We feel it is very safe, and an obligation to help provide herd immunity"
27826,R3ID032582,2021-06-09T14:03:38Z,NA,NA,NA,We. Have received it and are certain that it is effective. We received our first doses in February and second doses in March.
27833,R3ID032594,2021-06-09T23:11:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm fine with the vaccine, both my husband and I already received the two dose series. When it's available for my son's age group, he will be getting it as well."
27836,R3ID032594,2021-10-13T14:24:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the Pfizer vaccine and will get the booster shot when available for my age group. My son will also receive the vaccine when approved for his age group. My family is a big believer in science and vaccines and we want to always protect ourselves whenever we can. We're grateful to the scientists and test groups for pushing this through for us.
27838,R3ID032594,2021-12-08T15:29:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have already received the two-dose Pfizer vaccine. I have received the booster and my husband is scheduled to receive the booster. When the vaccine is approved for our child's age group, he will be receiving the vaccine as well. I believe the vaccine is important and that EVERYONE who can get it, should get it. It's selfish and ridiculous not to do so."
27839,R3ID032601,2021-09-16T19:56:35Z,NA,NA,3,I have it. It caused breathing problems for me for 3 weeks after
27841,R3ID032603,2021-07-07T14:18:13Z,NA,NA,6,I?m fully vaccinated
27843,R3ID032603,2021-10-13T16:31:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m in a high risk category. I was fully vaccinated by April 30th. And I intend to get the booster shot by the end of the month. I?ve already gotten the flu and pneumonia vaccines last week.

27847,R3ID032607,2021-04-16T15:44:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I have recieved my first of 2 shots.  I'm nervous about side effects but also more nervous about getting covid.
27848,R3ID032607,2021-07-08T15:46:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"Confident in its effectiveness,  all eligible people in our household and circle of people have been vaccinated"
27849,R3ID032607,2021-09-15T12:47:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe for me and my unborn baby. I was fully vaccinated just before conceiving.
27857,R3ID032609,2021-11-13T14:07:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I currently have the vaccine, unsure of how effective it is. I try to stay home as much as possible & away from the public."
27858,R3ID032612,2021-07-07T08:16:28Z,NA,NA,6,"I'm unsure about it, I feel I need more information. I will probably get it though as death is worse than side effects."
27865,R3ID032624,2021-07-07T11:05:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine to protect my son and elderly mom. Still not 100% sure it will help but I had to try

27892,R3ID032654,2021-11-10T21:04:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am not convinced it is effective, I feel the government is just trying anything they can to keep people calm but they don't know for sure if it even works. I am scare of all the side effects the vaccine can have in the future."
27897,R3ID032655,2021-04-14T11:14:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Still a little skeptical about the vaccine. I want to wait and see what some of the side effects will be
27899,R3ID032655,2021-05-12T09:57:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure about the safety and effectiveness and unsure if I?ll get it.
27901,R3ID032655,2021-06-09T12:10:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe the vaccines are effective but I?m not sure how safe they are because the clinical trials are still ongoing.
27903,R3ID032655,2021-07-07T12:44:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure about the safety for lactating women and their child.

27928,R3ID032665,2021-12-08T10:15:58Z,NA,NA,6,I would say my whole family is vaccinated and people should go for vaccination. It is working because people are getting cured sooner if they are vaccinated.
27929,R3ID032666,2021-04-14T12:53:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Don?t like it
27930,R3ID032666,2021-11-12T11:09:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it as I don?t feel that it is effective

I think for the overall short term it?s safe and effective but there?s no long term information and that is the nerve wracking part.
27947,R3ID032678,2021-04-14T07:39:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel the moderna and Pfizer vaccines are safe as of yet. More studies need to be done for pregnancy, breastfeeding and children going forward."

28136,R3ID032870,2021-11-11T15:55:09Z,NA,NA,NA,We are all getting it. I feel like I know nothing about the long term eats of the vaccine OR the virus itself so I would rather take our chances with the vaccine. My kids have never had adverse reactions to any vaccines so that feels like a lower risk than rolling the dice with the virus
28137,R3ID032870,2021-12-08T16:06:26Z,NA,NA,NA,All in our family eligible have received them
28139,R3ID032872,2021-04-16T18:29:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I know several ppl who has gotten it and a few have had bad allergic reactions to it. I think I want to wait longer before getting it.
28140,R3ID032872,2021-10-16T17:49:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I was concern about long term side effects and bad reaction to the vaccine.
28143,R3ID032872,2021-12-12T13:59:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I was in doubt about it as it was developed very fast in my opinion and I doubt it the safety of it but now I am for it and believe it does work. I have chosen to get it for the safety of my kids

28181,R3ID032918,2021-06-09T11:03:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I've gotten both doses and don't feel any different. If the vaccine helps to deter the virus then I'm all for it.
28183,R3ID032918,2021-07-08T19:41:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine. As far as knowing of its effectiveness, I only know what scientific studies have release to the public. I hope in the long run that it's as effective as they say it is."
28188,R3ID032918,2021-11-15T21:05:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like everyone should receive it.
28190,R3ID032918,2021-12-08T14:03:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Me and my family are fully vaccinated. We're ok. No real side effects. I haven't felt any out of the ordinary symptoms of Covid 19 so I guess it's working.
28197,R3ID032930,2021-04-14T08:03:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got the 1st one
28200,R3ID032930,2021-10-13T09:07:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure of safety, already got it"

28207,R3ID032934,2021-11-10T10:10:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm nervous about getting it
28208,R3ID032934,2021-12-08T12:18:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's un safe
28212,R3ID032938,2021-10-14T15:01:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m worried about having an allergic reaction to it. I believe it?s effective but question the ulterior motives of it now that it?s starting to be forced on us.
28213,R3ID032938,2021-12-09T19:24:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Im indifferent to it. I do plan to get it eventually but am worried for my own personal safety since I have had anaphylactic allergic reactions in the past. So I?ve been holding out for awhile now. He do not feel comfortable getting my children vaccinated with it however.
28214,R3ID032941,2021-10-13T17:03:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s very safe and very helpful and I?m so grateful for it.
28216,R3ID032944,2021-03-17T11:53:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't like it and know someone who acquired it even after receiving the vaccine.
28217,R3ID032944,2021-05-14T10:58:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Am still on the fence regarding the covid vaccination.
28227,R3ID032947,2021-12-15T08:47:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I am afraid to get it for my children as I?ve seen some things on the news. I am undecided if I want to get it for myself.

28235,R3ID032950,2021-12-08T11:22:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t agree with it being Mandatory in some cases but I did consider getting the vaccination
28239,R3ID032951,2021-03-17T18:42:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"Initially I had concerns but after trusted members of my family in the medical field got it, I felt comfortable getting the first dose."
28240,R3ID032951,2021-05-12T16:37:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine. I felt the benefits outweighed the risks.
28242,R3ID032951,2021-06-10T08:29:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are fully vaccinated. We are interested in how testing in kids 12 and younger is going because we are considering it for our kids, especially our oldest who will be entering full day Kindergarten in the fall and has asthma."
28243,R3ID032951,2021-07-08T08:53:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I am interested in the results of the trial for the children under 12.
28248,R3ID032951,2021-09-15T20:43:02Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are already vaccinated
28250,R3ID032951,2021-10-13T19:56:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve gotten it already. Waiting for study results on the 5-11 year olds.
28252,R3ID032951,2021-11-13T09:15:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?ve already gotten the vaccine and booster. I feel like it provides an added layer of protection for myself, the people I interact with, and particularly my young children."
28253,R3ID032951,2021-12-14T07:06:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve gotten 2 doses and a booster.
28260,R3ID032974,2021-06-10T23:34:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I dont know. I received mine, but I just dont know if I can trust the info provided"
28261,R3ID032974,2021-10-13T10:37:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"not sure about it's safety, but I got it b/c if there's any chance that it'll allow my child to experience a ""normal"" life again, i'll do it."
28265,R3ID032984,2021-05-14T12:29:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I will wait for more data to be released

28267,R3ID032984,2021-10-16T10:08:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I waited to see how others reacted and I believe it?s safe and effective. My hesitancy was due to breastfeeding.
28273,R3ID032994,2021-11-10T10:02:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is safe and effective and I am angry that it is not yet available for children under 5 years old. All members of all families should be able to be protected. We?ve had our family half vaccinated for months and months and it will be almost a year before we can all be vaccinated. My youngest is immunocompromised and the member of our family who is highest risk and needs the vaccine the most. While we wait on the vaccine for children under 5, we remain isolated and cut off from society and family."
28277,R3ID033004,2021-10-13T08:41:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated.  Now I have to decide if I?m going to get the booster.  It seems to be mostly effective keeping the individual safe, but people can still carry it and spread it, now more likely to be asymptomatic.  I?m still afraid of spreading it to my children.  And fully vaccinated people are still dying of COVID and I don?t understand that.  It?s making me lose faith in the vaccine"
28278,R3ID033004,2021-11-10T11:45:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten 2 Pfizer COVID vaccines.  My husband and my oldest daughter (21) are fully vaccinated.  I believe they are more effective than not, but all these break through cases make me question their effectiveness and I worry that the benefits may no longer outweigh the risk.  I am hesitant to bring my younger children to get it (4 and 6)."
28279,R3ID033004,2021-12-10T11:41:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated, but I hesitate to vaccinate my kids.  1 of my kids is not old enough yet (4), the other is 6, but I still hesitate"
28280,R3ID033015,2021-06-09T10:21:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"Won?t be getting it for myself or children. I wouldn?t trust a vaccine that didn?t have enough time to create. It?s a vaccine that you will have to get more than once in a year, and I don?t want that."
28285,R3ID033018,2021-11-11T03:55:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I am already vaccinated. I totally agree when they say that the benefits outweigh the risks.
28294,R3ID033033,2021-03-18T13:08:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Hoping it's effective. Recieved both doses of Modena
28295,R3ID033033,2021-04-14T08:53:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
28308,R3ID033042,2021-03-17T13:28:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is very safe and have faith in its effectiveness. I plan on receiving it during my third trimester of pregnancy (20 weeks now) if my OB recommends.
28310,R3ID033042,2021-05-12T08:02:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have just received my second dose today. For me, it felt much safer to get vaccinated than run the risk of contracting COVID in my third trimester of pregnancy."
28315,R3ID033042,2021-11-11T09:04:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"It has probably been more scrutinised than any other vaccine. I was vaccinated during my pregnancy with no side effects, and my baby is three months old and very healthy."
28318,R3ID033043,2021-05-13T09:10:04Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received the vaccine
28321,R3ID033044,2021-05-12T10:52:53Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe
28322,R3ID033044,2021-06-09T16:02:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it myself
28327,R3ID033044,2021-12-14T16:51:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Wish everybody got it
28330,R3ID033045,2021-12-10T13:52:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve already gotten it
28332,R3ID033048,2021-10-14T08:16:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in the my body my choice. Everyone has access to the information and can make their own decisions
28343,R3ID033073,2021-11-15T14:30:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is effective. We didn?t get covid after resuming outdoor activities. We got our vaccines in May 2020
28345,R3ID033073,2021-12-14T12:25:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is effective. We got it already.
28349,R3ID033080,2021-03-17T10:41:46Z,NA,NA,NA,Great! I already got mine and so has my husband
28351,R3ID033080,2021-06-09T09:46:21Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s safe and I already got mine
28353,R3ID033083,2021-05-13T12:20:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t trust it
28360,R3ID033086,2021-05-12T08:29:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it already and I feel safe about it

28375,R3ID033095,2021-10-13T09:53:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Too quickly developed
28377,R3ID033095,2021-11-12T09:57:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"I dont believe it works, not going to get it. And definitely not making my kids get it. It causes more harm than good"
28378,R3ID033095,2021-12-14T21:02:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"Do not like it, don't believe it is worth getting."
28380,R3ID033098,2021-07-08T08:36:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m sure it?s safe for most people I just am not interested at this time
28385,R3ID033103,2021-04-14T07:53:32Z,NA,NA,4,"I feel like there's a lot we don't know, in terms of side effects. Unfortunately, we won't be able to know what the long term effects (if any) until time passes. It's definitely worrisome to think about. I myself have already taken the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine after much thought and many hours of reading about possible side effects and self reports from online forums. I am still very concerned about the possibility of negative side effects that may surface later. However, I have older and health compromised parents so I chose to go ahead and hope for the best outcome."

28405,R3ID033120,2021-10-13T08:23:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received both doses of the vaccine, as for it's effectiveness, it was clear evidence that it does not completely protect against it. It may help slow it down."
28410,R3ID033126,2021-09-15T21:25:24Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s very safe and effective. I think everyone should get it. I am vaccinated.

Thus, the pros outweigh the cons of getting the vaccine to prevent severe illness from the virus."
28426,R3ID033137,2021-11-14T23:09:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received the vaccine. I was initially concerned about receiving it, and sometimes wonder what?s really in it/what the long term effects will be, but I do trust that the benefit of receiving it outweighs the risk of contracting Covid."
28429,R3ID033140,2021-12-08T11:49:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I understand that it doesn?t keep you from getting sick, but does reduce the chances (similar to other vaccines). It seems to have a good safety results overall. I do wish it would be more effective for longer periods. 
I have just received my booster (3rd) shot."

I feel like the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits for myself. But I do have family that I support and encourage to get the vaccine."
28434,R3ID033162,2021-03-17T11:04:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it?s too soon to know and I?m not sure I?ll get the vaccine once it?s available to me.
28436,R3ID033162,2021-04-14T07:06:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to see the effectiveness of it first before I get mine. I feel like it was rushed. I'm letting others who need/want it get there's first. I'm unsure if and when I will get it.

28562,R3ID033267,2021-06-10T11:01:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it needs way more testing - this rush through is leaving so much up to chance. I did get it though.
28565,R3ID033267,2021-11-14T15:34:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten the vaccine, but I'm not sure I will get it for our daughter. I feel that it hasn't been properly tested and tried over time (which I understand isn't possible right now in the thick of things), so I'm ok taking a gamble with my health if it means my daughter doesn't have to be stuck in the house 24/7, but I'm not ok making a possible dangerous choice for her before she's old enough to have a say."
28566,R3ID033267,2021-12-09T17:47:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have gotten the vaccine. He may get the booster, I will not because I am pregnant again. We do not plan to vaccinate our toddler or baby - I feel there just isn't enough research and extended results yet, and I don't want to make that decision for them."
28569,R3ID033272,2021-03-17T14:37:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe. I've already received both shots. My husband has received his first dose.
28572,R3ID033272,2021-09-15T15:57:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very safe and effective. As a healthcare worker, I was vaccinated in January."
28573,R3ID033277,2021-04-14T18:02:02Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received the first dose. I read many different university/medical center/doctors discussion on the vaccine safety.
28574,R3ID033277,2021-07-07T19:57:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"Confident in it, already got it."
28577,R3ID033277,2021-11-10T11:21:31Z,NA,NA,NA,It's safe and effective and I got mine in April.
28578,R3ID033277,2021-12-08T11:28:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in it. I got my booster last week.
28580,R3ID033282,2021-06-09T09:10:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it was too fast im not sure i can explain it in any eloquent way but it just seema like this was done entirely too quickly. I do not plan to receive a vaccine as of right now
28581,R3ID033282,2021-10-13T09:29:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm still on the fence. Im lucky to work.for a company that is not forcing us to vaccinate, i find that so completely wrong. Im not sure how to put it succinctly but i k ow i have issues with how fast the vaccine came out and the lack of course of long term effects. Also, if ppl are still getting sick and apreading it even vaccinated it just seems silly"
28584,R3ID033286,2021-05-12T11:04:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Not now until there are more studies.  How effective are these shots? Which one would be the best one to get? What all does it cover and for how long?
28585,R3ID033286,2021-12-08T18:52:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safety? I know a lot of people who have had complications after receiving the vaccine like the regular flu like symptoms, inflamed arm and heart attack. But then again most people have no issues at all ? so far. Most people I personally know who have been diagnosed with Covid have been vaccinated. Wether or not their illness would have been more or less severe? Who knows. Even in the beginning before the vaccination people would just describe the symptoms to me just the same as they do now. I myself had to get the vaccine to keep my job."
28588,R3ID033288,2021-11-14T09:45:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Nervous but I got my vaccine

28598,R3ID033310,2021-12-10T08:23:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine is well researched and safe, and my entire family (including children) are fully vaccinated, and the adults are boosted."
28604,R3ID033312,2021-05-14T08:48:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was skeptical because it?s so new but I recently got my first vaccine, waiting for my second. I?d rather have a side effect from doing anything I can do to protect myself and family than not do anything at all and get sick."
28606,R3ID033312,2021-06-11T02:26:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m unsure but I got it anyway
28609,R3ID033312,2021-09-17T06:26:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Still nervous because it?s so new but I did receive both moderna vaccines
28611,R3ID033312,2021-11-12T22:16:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am skeptical because of how new this vaccine is, there have been plenty of things deemed ""safe"" at first that have been deemed unsafe years later. I will not be getting my kids vaccinated. However, I got vaccinated because I work in an ICU and figure we need some people to get the vaccine for further research."
28613,R3ID033315,2021-04-15T13:31:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t plan to be vaccinated.  I?m not confident in its safety/effectiveness/necessity

28642,R3ID033355,2021-07-08T21:27:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is as safe and effective as it's going to be. I initially didn't want to get it.
28646,R3ID033358,2021-09-16T06:32:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Very good already got it

28708,R3ID033413,2021-05-13T16:56:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I am concerned about long term effects and if its anything like the flu shot it wont protect from all strains anyways
28714,R3ID033417,2021-05-12T07:46:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel comfortable with the COVID vaccine for myself.  I will be getting it after I deliver the baby I am pregnant with as I do not know enough about potential effects of the vaccine on my developing baby.

28785,R3ID033443,2021-04-14T08:43:20Z,NA,NA,NA,We will be vaccinated to protect others as well as ourselves.

28814,R3ID033461,2021-09-15T16:57:52Z,NA,NA,4,I think the vaccine is a good idea and safe to get. I have already gotten my full doses.

28830,R3ID033467,2021-12-10T15:18:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust the research that was put into this vaccine, and am fully vaccinated."
28834,R3ID033468,2021-12-08T09:12:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received 3 doses.  Everyone in my household who was able to get vaccinated has.  My child will get vaccinated as soon as he is able to.  I have 2 science degrees.  I fully trust the scientists who have been working on the vaccine.
28836,R3ID033469,2021-07-09T15:19:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I got mine as soon as I could. I believe it is safe and effective.
28837,R3ID033469,2021-11-11T09:54:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is safe, but am unsure how effective it is.  Most of the people I know who have gotten covid have been vaccinated. None were severely ill though.  I will got my vaccines and recently my booster. Something is better than nothing."
28840,R3ID033473,2021-11-11T14:09:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Myself and my husband are both vaccinated (and boostered!) and our 6 year old got her first vaccine Tuesday.

28860,R3ID033488,2021-03-18T07:49:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"Nope nope nope. Not safe being pushed through like it was. Not effective, or there wouldn't still be mask mandates and closures. I will not, my family will not. We'll wait and see who's alive after the shot 5 years from now."
28861,R3ID033488,2021-04-14T08:32:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't feel it's safe or effective. My family and myself will not receive it.
28862,R3ID033488,2021-05-12T15:35:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"Nope, Nope, Nope. Not safe, not effective, not happening."
28864,R3ID033489,2021-09-16T08:56:00Z,NA,NA,5,I received my vaccines a long time ago.
28867,R3ID033493,2021-10-13T08:29:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust the science and am trying to schedule my booster shot now.
28868,R3ID033493,2021-12-08T18:59:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is very low risk and I?ve had both shots and a booster. My 9 year old has had both shots and my husband. It?s safe, free and easy to access."

28874,R3ID033494,2021-11-10T11:56:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I and all teens and adults in immediate family are vaccinated. We are waiting to see how it does in young children before having the 5 year old vaccinated. We?d also like to wait for the Moderna to be approved for kids because of the rate of efficacy.
28877,R3ID033496,2021-07-07T13:18:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Cautious. Want more trials.
28879,R3ID033497,2021-10-13T08:46:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is less risky to get the vaccine than to deal with the potential complications of COVID. I am fully vaccinated.
28880,R3ID033497,2021-11-15T19:08:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is most likely as safe as any other vaccine.  I am vaccinated and intend to vaccinate my children.
28884,R3ID033500,2021-06-09T11:43:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated. I think it is safe & effective. I?m very happy to be protected so ai can be healthy for my children!
28888,R3ID033500,2021-12-08T10:37:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe & effective. I have been fully vaccinated.
28891,R3ID033501,2021-10-16T09:05:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"Everyone old enough in my immediate family is fully vaccinated and I have helped administer 16,000+ vaccines in my county"
28894,R3ID033502,2021-04-14T09:30:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got both of my vaccines already, as did my husband."
28895,R3ID033502,2021-06-09T17:16:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. The benefits outweigh the risks.
28897,R3ID033502,2021-07-07T08:23:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the risks of covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine and that the vaccine has a clear benefit. I got it and encouraged family members to get it.
28903,R3ID033503,2021-05-13T22:24:24Z,NA,NA,NA,it is not tested. Who knows the outcome later in life. Past has proven that injections are not truly safe. I will never get it nor will my children. The virus is treatable.
28905,R3ID033503,2021-10-16T19:00:50Z,NA,NA,NA,It is not safe. Too many reports of side effects and also lack of long-term studies makes it unsafe. It has turned into a political vaccine which means myself and my direct family will never get it.
28907,R3ID033503,2021-12-10T21:02:05Z,NA,NA,NA,Its a joke. I also wonder why it is being pushed so much throughout the world. The horrible things that are happening where people who do not want to get it are losing their lives. It is horrible and should make anyone stop and think for a moment why it is being pushed so hard when it has been proven to not be so effective and natural immunity is not even thought of.
28911,R3ID033506,2021-07-08T08:32:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it and I believe it?s safe.
28914,R3ID033506,2021-09-16T22:04:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and effective and I?ve already gotten it.
28916,R3ID033507,2021-05-12T08:23:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got both doses. Science rocks!
28921,R3ID033507,2021-12-09T22:49:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is amazing and I have all three and my kids have their two shots. Science is world changing and real!
28927,R3ID033509,2021-07-07T10:39:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"Myself, husband, and my teen daughter have received both doses of the vaccine."
28934,R3ID033510,2021-12-08T10:19:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"The results are conflicting, the whole issue is too politicized, and if the shot works there shouldn't be any fears from the vaccinated.  We will wait until we feel.the vaccine is safe and does not need so many doses and boosters to work correctly.   And yes, our children are vaccinated with the normal routine shots as we had time to read non politicized information, without fear mongering."
28937,R3ID033512,2021-05-13T12:23:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's safe, I've had both doses"
28939,R3ID033513,2021-03-18T12:11:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I will be getting it after my baby is born in April 2021. I believe they are generally safe and are less risky than getting COVID.
28941,R3ID033513,2021-06-09T16:22:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received J&J vaccine. I believe it is lower risk than catching COVID would be.
28945,R3ID033513,2021-10-16T07:44:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it shortly after my pregnancy. I do believe it?s safe and at least as effective as the flu shot, which I get every year, so I was glad to get it. I still wear masks but that?s a whole other thing."
28951,R3ID033517,2021-06-09T09:18:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"it's safe, everyone who can should get it, I got it"
28953,R3ID033517,2021-11-10T10:18:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, effective, got it, signed up my 5-year-old as soon as it was OK'd"
28954,R3ID033520,2021-04-14T18:51:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and I got it
28956,R3ID033520,2021-06-09T12:48:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I think it is safe and effective. I do believe some peole experience severe side effects.
28957,R3ID033520,2021-07-07T10:55:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. It is safe and effective.
28961,R3ID033520,2021-10-13T12:40:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe. Critical to get everyone vaccinated for community effectiveness. I got it. I understand there are side effects and rare serious risks
28964,R3ID033521,2021-05-13T20:22:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received both shots.
28965,R3ID033521,2021-07-08T08:14:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I got both shots. I feel it?s the best defense against COVID.
28968,R3ID033521,2021-11-12T09:08:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I have it. So does my husband and my son got his 1st one
28971,R3ID033522,2021-03-18T19:06:05Z,NA,NA,NA,Will get it in the coming months
28978,R3ID033527,2021-04-14T08:40:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received the vaccine. I did my research and feel confident behind my decision.
28983,R3ID033532,2021-03-17T21:27:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think thay the risk of various side effects is worth the shot for my non-high risk family
28985,R3ID033532,2021-11-10T13:49:26Z,NA,NA,NA,It is not anywhere near as safe or effective as the media makes it sound. I will never get it.
28987,R3ID033535,2021-04-14T11:46:19Z,NA,NA,NA,We?re getting it
28988,R3ID033535,2021-07-09T10:48:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve received both vaccinations to help slow virus
28989,R3ID033535,2021-10-13T08:32:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve received it
28993,R3ID033538,2021-09-15T08:55:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it in the spring. At the time, I wondered if the side effects were worth it because cases were already dropping precipitously. When my older kids became eligible, I was concerned about myocarditis. However, as Delta took over and cases and hospital space again trended in the wrong direction, my older kids got the vaccine. I am happy with my choice and that my older kids are vaccinated now."
28995,R3ID033540,2021-03-17T11:46:18Z,NA,NA,NA,For me the risks outweigh benefits and I do not plan on getting it
29011,R3ID033546,2021-06-10T08:40:19Z,NA,NA,NA,Pretty confident
29015,R3ID033547,2021-07-09T16:27:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I am uncertain about the vaccine.

29034,R3ID033564,2021-09-16T08:48:51Z,NA,NA,NA,No I do not trust it. No one in my household will be getting it.
29045,R3ID033566,2021-10-13T15:19:18Z,NA,NA,NA,It works
29047,R3ID033566,2021-11-10T14:41:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it
29049,R3ID033568,2021-03-17T09:57:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vaccine is too new to know if there will be adverse effects and I don?t plan on myself or family getting it any time in the near future.
29050,R3ID033568,2021-04-14T14:44:12Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure

29056,R3ID033571,2021-11-12T10:35:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is safe and fairly effective, though it?s effectiveness against Delta variant and potential other new variants is less than the initial research numbers. I have gotten it and intend on getting a booster when available."
29060,R3ID033572,2021-06-10T15:23:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Already have it!
29061,R3ID033572,2021-10-13T12:29:48Z,NA,NA,NA,100% trust
29066,R3ID033581,2021-05-12T09:00:14Z,NA,NA,NA,There is not enough long term evidence of potential risks.

29128,R3ID033611,2021-10-13T13:22:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got the vaccine. I was a little nervous because it is new but I think it is effective in preventing severe Covid and decreases transmission.
29130,R3ID033611,2021-12-08T13:34:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s pretty safe and it has value. It seems effective at preventing severe symptoms and seems to decrease the likelihood of contracting covid. I wish it could be more robust but I?m grateful we have have it.

29151,R3ID033616,2021-05-12T07:29:52Z,NA,NA,NA,As for my children I am very unsure of it's safety. There has not been enough time to know the true side effects.
29155,R3ID033617,2021-04-16T15:49:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaccinated
29159,R3ID033617,2021-09-15T08:54:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten it, and intend to get it for my children as soon as they are eligible."
29160,R3ID033617,2021-10-13T09:12:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got mine!
29162,R3ID033617,2021-11-12T09:09:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust the doctors and medical researchers. I?m vaccinated, and my children will be."
29170,R3ID033620,2021-07-07T08:39:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, plan to vaccinate my kids ASAP"
29171,R3ID033620,2021-11-14T09:12:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"Our risks of our conditions worsening due to COVID, and having complications are already high. I feel like the vaccine has less risks for us.
I, myself, have had both doses AND third dose (due to immune deficiency). Even with Mast cell Activation, I was fine. I?d like to get the kids vaccinated, but there?s little opportunities to get them vaccinated right away. No doctors office have them, pharmacies (so far) only making appointments for 12+?. It?s left us VERY frustrated, as we see family/friends in other states getting their kids vaccinated easily."
29174,R3ID033622,2021-03-17T09:01:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Initial concerns about risks with minimal long term research. I plan to get it.
29179,R3ID033623,2021-04-15T14:43:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I hope it is safe long term and I have gotten the shot
29190,R3ID033629,2021-05-12T08:13:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I've gotten it and feel hopeful it can end this pandemic
29192,R3ID033629,2021-07-08T08:51:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have happily received it, but I can't help but be wary of giving it to my child (who is still ineligible)."
29194,R3ID033629,2021-10-13T11:32:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it, and everyone should get it. It's the only way to beat the virus."
29199,R3ID033630,2021-09-16T12:47:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe & already got it
29200,R3ID033633,2021-03-17T12:57:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received it. I believe it is safe and effective
29203,R3ID033634,2021-10-14T13:21:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I had to get it. I believe it should be freedom of choice; however, as I did not like being coerced or bullied to get it. I am well versed that it is effective in reducing severe illness though does not eliminate risk of infection. I have these viewpoints because we should have rights to make our own medical choices. I am in favor of the vaccination, but forcing people to get it while it is under emergency use was not acceptable to me. Give people the facts and let them decide."
29205,R3ID033636,2021-07-09T08:06:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not against vaccines but I am worried about possible side effects and maybe not being able to have more kids
29206,R3ID033637,2021-07-07T08:47:08Z,NA,NA,7,"I trust that it?s safe and effective, and I have already received both doses."

29209,R3ID033639,2021-06-11T08:29:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe
29213,R3ID033645,2021-09-15T13:46:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"already received, waiting impatiently for young children to be eligible"
29218,R3ID033647,2021-11-14T09:18:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I've received it; my husband has received it; and my 5 year old just received her first dose yesterday. We believe in it and we think it's safe; we are disappointed that others are not taking a more proactive approach to getting their vaccine.
29221,R3ID033655,2021-10-13T08:43:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not enough data, no"
29223,R3ID033656,2021-07-07T11:59:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine and encourage anyone else who is eligible to get it
29224,R3ID033656,2021-09-15T12:43:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got vaccine, I think it is relatively safe and effective"
29225,R3ID033656,2021-10-13T11:50:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got the vaccine
29227,R3ID033657,2021-05-12T08:41:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"I looked into it and tried to understand it the best I could, talked to my kids' doctor about it, and I trust the scientists and doctors. I have received both my shots and intend to get them for my kids when it is approved for young kids."
29231,R3ID033657,2021-09-15T08:55:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as it was available to me. I trust the scientists and doctors who have dedicated their lives to this kind of stuff.
29232,R3ID033657,2021-10-14T08:18:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust all the doctors and scientists who say it?s safe and protective. I can also see how safe and effective it?s been, as numbers are dropping."
29234,R3ID033657,2021-12-08T09:29:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten it, I'm planning to get the booster soon. My older son is not eligible and I want to get him vaccinated ASAP but I'm needing to convince my husband. I feel better about any potential side effects than I do about COVID. I trust the people who have dedicated their lives to this."
29238,R3ID033659,2021-05-12T13:08:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it. I trust science and doctors.
29239,R3ID033659,2021-06-10T08:11:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's a necessary tool to end the pandemic and a safe way to do so.
29244,R3ID033659,2021-12-08T12:19:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am 100% pro vaccine. I know MRNA vaccine technology has been in the works a long while and will help in the fight against cancer.

I am 3x vaccinated with Moderna (immunocomprimised)."
29250,R3ID033662,2021-06-10T10:28:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m concerned about the long term affects. I have no plans in getting it currently.
29258,R3ID033665,2021-11-10T09:45:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. I am fully vaccinated and getting my booster next week. I plan to vaccinate my child when it is approved for kids under 5.
29259,R3ID033665,2021-12-12T06:53:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. I've had both doses and my booster.
29266,R3ID033668,2021-10-13T22:47:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe the vaccines are safe and effective. They would be more effective if more people would get them tho. Me and my husband have already had both doses and are planning on a booster
29267,R3ID033668,2021-12-08T09:03:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's very safe, compared to actually contracting covid. I think it does help with immunity and would be better effective if more people would get it. Me and my husband have already had our 2 shots as well as out booster. My son is 2 and when it becomes available to his age group, I will get it for him"
29270,R3ID033669,2021-06-10T10:42:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"Totally safe, no concerns for me. I worry that my kid won't understand what is going on and also worry about siezures due to high fever."
29278,R3ID033672,2021-09-15T09:06:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"i'm extremely grateful that the vaccines have been developed and are available to us. I have already gotten mine and will be getting them for my children once they're available. However, I do still have some slight concerns about long term effects. At this time, I am more concerned about getting COVID and its effects, though."
29280,R3ID033673,2021-11-10T09:10:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m not comfortable getting it, due to previous reactions and having lupus myself."
29283,R3ID033674,2021-04-14T20:10:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I got my first vaccine today! I feel confident in taking it for myself based on the research I have seen thus far.
29285,R3ID033674,2021-11-11T06:50:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had both doses and received my booster this week. My 5 year old is scheduled for his first dose tomorrow.
29289,R3ID033675,2021-03-17T14:51:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"F that. They didn't even finish the mice studies. And its gene therapy, not a vaccine."
29290,R3ID033675,2021-09-17T08:15:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t trust these mfers. I get every other vaccine including boosters and flu. Too many reproductive side effects.
29292,R3ID033675,2021-10-13T15:42:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I need someone to explain to me how your body ever stops making the spike proteins. Waaaay too many people in my charting groups had cycle issues after the shot- periods two weeks long, no period for months, miscarriages, no longer able to confirm ovulation after years of charting, etc. so unless that ever gets straightened out I?m not getting it."
29294,R3ID033679,2021-05-12T08:51:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten both doses
29295,R3ID033679,2021-07-09T09:43:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I have both doses and I trust that it is safe and effective
29299,R3ID033680,2021-06-09T22:51:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's great and I already have mine
29301,R3ID033680,2021-12-08T11:44:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel they are safe and effective just as other vaccines are. I have received 2 doses so far and have my booster shot scheduled for next week.
29304,R3ID033681,2021-10-13T09:00:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it because I had to (health professional) and almost got hospitalized because of it. I?m strongly against the mandates and believe folks are making their best decisions and this culture of shame around it is absolutely disgusting to me.
29306,R3ID033681,2021-11-10T09:58:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I got J&J because I was mandated (health care worker). I think the mandates are bullshit and adults can be trusted to make their own decisions about it.
29310,R3ID033683,2021-07-07T10:24:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten two doses
29319,R3ID033684,2021-12-08T11:09:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I have no concerns

29323,R3ID033685,2021-11-10T10:19:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and will get the booster. My children will be vaccinated as soon as they can. In feel like the vaccine has been very well researched. I?m comfortable
29329,R3ID033689,2021-03-17T20:05:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting right away
29331,R3ID033689,2021-05-14T11:13:29Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure- haven?t gotten it yet
29334,R3ID033689,2021-09-16T10:48:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"We got it recently , still nervous about side effects just sick of covid"
29335,R3ID033689,2021-10-14T08:04:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it but unsure about it
29337,R3ID033689,2021-12-12T18:19:54Z,NA,NA,NA,Nervous because we don?t know long term effects. My husband and I received it but my husband doesn?t want booster and we don?t know what we will decide for children
29340,R3ID033693,2021-03-17T09:40:35Z,NA,NA,NA,No
29347,R3ID033695,2021-09-15T09:19:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Very confident. I got vaccinated as soon as I was able
29348,R3ID033695,2021-12-08T09:14:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel great about it! My husband and I got vaccinated in March and my two eligible children (5 and 7) are fully vaccinated on Friday!
29355,R3ID033703,2021-05-14T13:16:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I am comfortable with it
29356,R3ID033703,2021-07-08T10:05:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
29358,R3ID033703,2021-11-10T09:28:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I think its safe but not that effective. I have already received it.
29359,R3ID033703,2021-12-14T19:05:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe but not as effective as once thought. I did get it already.
29367,R3ID033704,2021-11-10T10:40:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?ve already gotten it and will be getting the booster soon. I?m all for it, it?s just as safe as any other vaccine we receive."
29369,R3ID033704,2021-12-12T09:54:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s very safe and fairly effective. I?ve gotten two doses and will receive my booster soon
29372,R3ID033706,2021-03-19T12:58:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it
29373,R3ID033706,2021-06-11T09:08:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm skeptical
29375,R3ID033707,2021-03-17T11:01:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am planning on getting it as soon as we are eligible. While I have some trepidations, the benefits of getting it far outweigh the slight trepidation."
29379,R3ID033708,2021-04-14T08:11:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in its safety
29380,R3ID033708,2021-05-13T21:49:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good and am vaccinated

29405,R3ID033714,2021-04-15T10:47:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is relatively safe and may only provide temporary protection from the virus. Will probably need to get it every year like the flu shot. I will probably get it though.
29407,R3ID033714,2021-05-12T13:26:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is fine to get the vaccine. I am receiving my second shot on my day off this Friday.

30302,R3ID034169,2021-07-08T12:19:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it should be given to those whose bodies are fully developed. For younger children, no."
30305,R3ID034169,2021-10-14T19:38:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe they are effective at lessening its effects, but only works when most of the population contrubutes."
30307,R3ID034169,2021-11-10T16:50:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"I already received mine. I think it is safe for those without underlying conditions and those who do not wish to procreate. For children, I am unsure if it will affect their growth or fertility in the future, so my children will not be getting it."
30309,R3ID034169,2021-12-09T10:02:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received it. I feel it will help slow the spread, but if enough do not get vaccinated in enough time, it will continue to mutate and be less effective."
30310,R3ID034173,2021-03-18T17:43:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get it when it is more easily available
30313,R3ID034173,2021-10-13T11:00:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine, I am not sure of its true safety -- I guess we will know in a few decades if there are lasting effects (positive or negative)"
30318,R3ID034175,2021-04-15T17:36:17Z,NA,NA,NA,We will not be getting it. I don't feel it's safe or has been tested enough.
30328,R3ID034186,2021-06-09T09:50:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s safe and effective. The ?risks? of the vaccine are theoretical/speculative. The risks associated with actual COVID infection are real and I know multiple people dealing with long COVID symptoms.
30342,R3ID034206,2021-06-10T12:28:38Z,NA,NA,4,I think it was approved to early and I will not be getting it for a while.
30346,R3ID034206,2021-12-08T09:12:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not feel it?s doing it?s job and there wasn?t enough research done on it. I do not plan to get it anytime soon.
30349,R3ID034208,2021-03-19T03:07:58Z,NA,NA,NA,So far the data indicates that it is very safe. I plan to get the vaccine when I am able
30352,R3ID034208,2021-05-14T00:19:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I both recieved both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. I was hesitant and firs, but read a lot and spoke with my doctors and midwife and decided it was safe even while breastfeeding"
30354,R3ID034208,2021-09-16T12:45:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's very safe. I was vaccinated in May
30359,R3ID034214,2021-11-12T10:48:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel as if there is so much information that it is hard to gauge what is unbiased.  I speak to my doctor regarding my children, and have spoken to my doctor in regards to my own vaccine."
30361,R3ID034215,2021-09-15T16:45:04Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I are fully vaccinated and we 100% approve of the available vaccines.
30365,R3ID034216,2021-05-13T03:27:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already
30366,R3ID034216,2021-07-07T08:34:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is relatively safe. My husband and I both got it and my children will get it when it's available.
30367,R3ID034216,2021-10-14T17:26:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as i was in the 2nd trimester
30368,R3ID034216,2021-12-14T13:17:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I got both when pregnant and the booster at 2 weeks postpartum. I am 100% for the vaccine and anxiously waiting for it to be approved for my toddler and newborn (probably 6 months before she will be able to get it if approved for infants).
30369,R3ID034217,2021-10-16T13:17:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it and believe in vaccines
30372,R3ID034219,2021-05-12T11:20:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I would get it for my child
30373,R3ID034219,2021-06-09T09:55:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Probably fine but a little anxious
30379,R3ID034221,2021-03-18T12:15:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I think that it is a good thing that it came out so quickly however long term effects are unknown and that worries me.
30382,R3ID034221,2021-06-10T10:10:39Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s good that they have something.
30383,R3ID034221,2021-09-17T12:06:22Z,NA,NA,NA,We already have ours

30392,R3ID034238,2021-03-17T09:38:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not feel that it is something I am willing to get right now due to my own health issues.
30394,R3ID034238,2021-04-16T12:26:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"Do like the current ones being offered due to health reasons, waiting for the norvax vaccine to be available"
30397,R3ID034238,2021-12-12T13:03:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am getting my second dose today, don't really feel it's somewhat that should be required as its not a true vaccine. But one that is close to the flu vaccine."
30398,R3ID034241,2021-10-13T11:06:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are fully vaccinated, and we feel like the very small risks associated with the vaccine are tiny compared to the benefit of having the vaccine during this pandemic."
30400,R3ID034241,2021-11-14T13:06:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"The vaccine benefits, both individual and for the community/society, are so much greater than the risks.  We got vaccinated as soon as we were eligible (and could get an appointment), and plan to vaccinate our three year old when his age group gets approved (assuming the risk profile for small children looks similar to the current vaccine risk profile)."
30403,R3ID034245,2021-11-10T09:46:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it and have received both doses
30406,R3ID034247,2021-04-15T13:24:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't know if it has long term effects or how long the immunity lasts, so I'm not going to take it at this time."
30413,R3ID034252,2021-03-17T22:22:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerns of reactions but will still get it
30415,R3ID034252,2021-04-15T05:35:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerned but worth the risk
30421,R3ID034253,2021-04-14T10:01:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got it as soon as I could, happy they are doing trials for children"
30424,R3ID034254,2021-05-13T08:50:36Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both fully vaccinated.

30436,R3ID034256,2021-06-09T13:06:16Z,NA,NA,6,"I received the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, I drove 3.5 hours to get it that day. I believe it is safer than getting COVID-19 or spreading it."
30439,R3ID034256,2021-09-15T15:33:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m vaccinated. Everyone in my family over 12, except one nephew, also is. It?s safer than spreading COVID-19 and it?s safer than getting COVID-19. It?s not perfect, but it?s the best option and very good."
30440,R3ID034256,2021-11-10T13:59:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am vaccinated. I plan on getting my booster, but because I was a little icky for a day after my last shot, I?m waiting until the holiday weekend so I will have two consecutive days off. I can?t call out of work.
I think it?s safe and more effective then not getting it. Viruses mutate so as long as its spreading in the community there will be new variations. 
As soon as it is available for my daughter she will receive it."
30443,R3ID034257,2021-06-11T08:08:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine myself and when available for my children they will get it too.

30452,R3ID034259,2021-12-09T00:25:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm about to schedule me and my husband booster and am looking forward to it being approved for my 2 year old son.
30454,R3ID034260,2021-05-12T10:02:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"Received 1st dose of Moderna- had a life threatening reaction and wound up in hospital. Not eligible for the 2nd dose. I'm not averse to others getting it and think that it's overall a good idea, but I have reservations"
30455,R3ID034260,2021-07-09T16:50:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I got first dose and wound up hospitalized again due to the reaction. Not eligible for the 2nd shot. Kids arent getting it
30461,R3ID034263,2021-04-14T07:13:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Will get second dose in 2 days.
30463,R3ID034263,2021-10-14T11:08:11Z,NA,NA,NA,We believe in science (and mRNA vaccines aren?t new)

30467,R3ID034269,2021-07-08T08:09:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I got vaccinated.  I believe in science.
30468,R3ID034269,2021-11-10T20:28:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m fully vaccinated.  I?m not sure about vaccinating my children.
30472,R3ID034271,2021-07-09T09:24:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and believe it?s safe
30477,R3ID034272,2021-11-12T12:40:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the vaccine. I believe it is effective. The side effects that I experienced are the reason I haven?t gotten a 3rd shot yet. I would want to make sure fertility studies are done before giving it to my daughter.
30485,R3ID034280,2021-10-13T09:30:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm all about it. I'm fully vaccinated and will get a booster once available.
30491,R3ID034287,2021-03-17T09:27:50Z,NA,NA,3,I don?t think it?s safe. I?m not getting it bc I refuse to be a guinea pig.
30492,R3ID034287,2021-06-09T09:21:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am waiting bc right now I feel like bc it wasn?t tested beforehand, it?s not safe. Idk what?s in it or what it?ll do to me."
30494,R3ID034287,2021-09-15T14:09:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it til more data concludes that it?s safe and doesn?t make women infertile
30495,R3ID034287,2021-11-15T22:11:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m unsure of if it?s safe or not. Keep reading it could cause infertility. Also, it was made very quickly and we don?t know what the long term side effects are. I don?t think it?s effective at all. I know at least 10 ppl who have gotten the shot and then had Covid. Not only that, but they don?t even know how many shots you?ll need to be ?safe?."
30501,R3ID034288,2021-07-07T11:23:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"Both my husband and I got it, still not available for kiddo"
30505,R3ID034289,2021-11-10T11:36:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I want to get it, but keep putting it off because I am worried about what it might do to your body years down the road"

I have 3x pfizer.3"
30527,R3ID034298,2021-07-08T08:36:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I personally will let it run its course for I get it for myself due to what I feel is the lack of evidence in either direction in regards to pregnancy and childbearing. Most of my family members including my husband have received the vaccine.
30530,R3ID034298,2021-09-16T09:13:19Z,NA,NA,NA,Now that we are on track for FDA approval and has time to talk with my PCP and OB I will be getting the vaccine within the next month or two.
30531,R3ID034298,2021-10-13T12:41:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I have a fairly positive thoughts about it and will become vaccinated when all vaccines have received full FDA approval
30534,R3ID034300,2021-04-14T08:50:04Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it. Not enough research.
30535,R3ID034300,2021-05-12T15:35:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think it has had enough testing
30536,R3ID034300,2021-06-09T09:56:16Z,NA,NA,NA,It has not been tested long enough

30548,R3ID034304,2021-11-14T10:25:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Positive and adults have been vaccinated. The children will when available
30549,R3ID034304,2021-12-14T13:11:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I want all members of my family to have the vaccine
30552,R3ID034305,2021-12-08T12:25:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in the vaccine. My husband and I are fully vaccinated and have received boosters. I am mostly confident for our children but have not opted to enroll them in clinical trials for early access.
30556,R3ID034312,2021-12-08T10:53:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is as safe as we are able to get it at tthe momeent, itt iis necessaryy and itt is effective. I have received mine as well as a booster, and all my eligible chiildren and family have as well"
30559,R3ID034318,2021-04-14T17:37:21Z,NA,NA,6,I believe it is safe and effective.  I already got both doses.

30576,R3ID034328,2021-03-17T11:06:37Z,NA,NA,6,"Already got my first dose and will get second in a few weeks. I believe it is effective at preventing serious illness and while the long term effects are unknown, neither are the long term effects of contracting Covid-19"
30578,R3ID034331,2021-04-14T08:55:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received #1, #2 is next week. I think it offers a layer of protection but I believe immunity is short-lived."
30581,R3ID034334,2021-11-11T16:30:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get my booster soon. I am so happy we have a vaccine. I believe it's safe and effective

30599,R3ID034342,2021-09-15T08:52:03Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m vaccinated, I worry about it?s effectiveness as new strains of this virus keep popping up and no one takes it seriously"
30607,R3ID034345,2021-06-10T08:51:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I feel that the social implications and obligations outweigh the risk of the unknown long-term side effects (if any) and I feel comfortable with the short-term side effects and risks that have been disclosed
30608,R3ID034345,2021-09-16T15:01:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I plan to get it as an adult for the purposes of helping society and the people around me that are at risk. I do feel that it has some risks particularly that we do not know long term results, but I think that I am willing to take those risks"
30609,R3ID034345,2021-10-14T22:41:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, but I understand people up are hesitant due to the short time we have had to gather information on it. I felt my social obligation as a social worker outweighed the unknown"
30613,R3ID034348,2021-05-12T13:26:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it
30614,R3ID034348,2021-12-10T09:22:30Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective- got the vaccine plus a booster
30617,R3ID034351,2021-06-10T09:08:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. I trust the science behind it.
30618,R3ID034351,2021-07-08T08:31:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it. I trust the experts
30625,R3ID034355,2021-03-17T12:19:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it when it's available because I trust science.
30626,R3ID034355,2021-04-15T08:56:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm getting my first shot tomorrow. I'm getting Moderma, I think it's called. I definitely don't trust the J&J one. Not after it was proven that they knew about the asbestos in talc and did nothing."
30629,R3ID034355,2021-12-09T09:31:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, but I?m not sure how effective it is. I don?t understand why I have to get a booster if they don?t know if the booster will help with the new variant. I?ve also had shortness of breath ever since I got vaccinated."
30631,R3ID034358,2021-03-17T09:14:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I have full faith in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. I plan on getting the vaccine for everyone in our family as soon as we are eligible.

30637,R3ID034358,2021-09-16T10:03:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Vaccinated as soon as it was available. I have no concerns about the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine
30646,R3ID034362,2021-10-13T08:37:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and I am probably 75% confident that it will be okay long term side effects wise though I am no discouraged because it seems to not be effective at preventing illness or spread at all. At least it prevents death and serious illness most of the time but that is still concerning when you live with unvaccinated kids.
30648,R3ID034362,2021-12-08T10:27:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve gotten all three shots. I am comfortable with it and believe it helps though I?ve lost hope that it prevents anyone from getting covid.

30669,R3ID034376,2021-10-13T12:04:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I did get it to give my child some immunity.  My family all believes that it helps but we are surprised by the current spread given the vaccine being in place.
30671,R3ID034376,2021-11-10T16:20:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve gotten it and I believe it is safe

30710,R3ID034418,2021-03-17T08:45:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Don't trust the hurried testing. Ethical dilemma of how it was made and the ingredients
30711,R3ID034418,2021-07-07T08:26:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Too fast not enough side effects research
30714,R3ID034418,2021-10-13T08:15:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enough research on side effects. Also not very effective if a booster is needed already and alot of people who got the vaccine are still getting covid

30793,R3ID034487,2021-11-14T10:03:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it's safe. I can admit I had a lot of hesitation at first just because it was so fast to be developed. However the fact that it is essentially a modified vaccine from SARS, reassured me. I have gotten it and my 6 year old has gotten her first dose"
30794,R3ID034487,2021-12-14T13:42:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's safe. I've already gotten it and the booster.

30818,R3ID034496,2021-11-10T14:10:03Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have never been vaccinated and have never been sick. My kids have never been vaccinated and have never been sick. Every vaccinated person I know has been sick before. Every never vaccinated person I know has never been sick. Some vaccinated people get sick almost every year. There is absolutely no chance I will ever get any vaccine. I have heard about forced vaccines over 20 years ago by eugenicists, and have been prepared to fight against them. I know of people who have had strokes, heart attacks, and died of the vaccine."
30819,R3ID034496,2021-12-10T08:35:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have never been vaccinated with any vaccine and have never been sick. Every vaccinated person I know has been sick before and many of them get sick every single year. None of the never vaccinated people I know have ever been sick. Vaccinated people have all kinds of health problems. Vaccines even list fertility reducing chemicals right on the label and scientists have found other fertility reducing chemicals that were not on the label. Independent scientists who are not funded with tax dollars have explained in detail what the COVID-19 vaccine does to the blood and organs with actual photos and videos taken with microscopes. Eugenicists have been planning on reducing the population with vaccines for over 40 years. Online news reporters have been warning of forced vaccines for over 20 years as a plan to reduce the population. I actually expected this to happen over 10 years ago. I will use any means necessary to fight against any vaccine. Nobody will ever vaccinate me, I have a right to self defense! I bought a farm expecting food shortages to happen so I wouldn't have to worry about running out of food. I can't get fired if I don't have a boss. If the entire economy collapses I can just stay home and survive. I have all the defenses I need to fight if they declare war and try to force vaccinate people. Nobody will come on my property with a deadly poison filled needle."
30830,R3ID034504,2021-12-08T09:00:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it due to professional pressure and as a safety for my son whose 4 years old.
30831,R3ID034506,2021-04-14T10:30:01Z,NA,NA,1,I?m still not sure about it
30832,R3ID034506,2021-11-10T14:48:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t plan on getting it because I?m not sure if it?s effectiveness or how my body will react to it
30833,R3ID034506,2021-12-08T12:29:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t think I will get it
30836,R3ID034508,2021-04-16T11:19:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"safe, effective, and I have already been vaccinated"

30856,R3ID034513,2021-09-15T09:21:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it
30858,R3ID034514,2021-07-08T12:36:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"Won?t get it. It hasn?t been approved by the FDA, no long term studies on its effects either"
30863,R3ID034518,2021-03-17T10:24:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm trying to set an appointment right now
30865,R3ID034518,2021-07-08T08:24:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm vaccinated.
30870,R3ID034518,2021-12-08T09:57:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel pretty good about it. W
I was nervous about it at first because of how fast it came out, and especially nervous when it seemed like a vaccine for six month olds was going to come out super duper fast, but by the time it was actually available to me, we jumped on it. Me and spouse are both vaccinated, and got our boosters already too."
30872,R3ID034520,2021-03-18T00:09:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Not for me
30873,R3ID034520,2021-04-15T13:43:02Z,NA,NA,NA,nope dont want it

30879,R3ID034527,2021-09-15T09:08:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in the science behind the vaccine and I have received it.
30887,R3ID034546,2021-11-11T19:01:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Everybody except for my youngest child is fully vaccinated, and we all plan to get the boosters when they are available. I trust the science, and I feel like illness would have been much worse if I was not vaccinated."
30890,R3ID034547,2021-03-17T09:31:29Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective
30894,R3ID034547,2021-11-10T19:08:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's very safe and effective. I have already received the vaccine, and will receive a booster soon. My children will receive the vaccine when it's available for children under 5"
30895,R3ID034550,2021-09-17T14:56:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I have to get it bc i work healthcare but i do not feel it is safe
30897,R3ID034552,2021-03-19T13:43:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Im afraid that they did it too quick and we don't know the effects.  I don't know about getting it.
30899,R3ID034553,2021-06-09T08:06:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it already. I trust it to be safe and effective.
30902,R3ID034553,2021-11-10T10:24:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I appreciate how quickly it was able to be approved, got it as soon as I could, and will get it for my kids as soon as they are able."
30903,R3ID034553,2021-12-08T09:08:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my vaccine plus booster and will get it for my children as soon as it's available to Under 5s. I trust it's safety and the data has provided it's effectiveness.
30909,R3ID034556,2021-07-08T08:32:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm confident in its safety and received it.
30910,R3ID034556,2021-09-15T11:57:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in it's safety and effectiveness.  I received it as soon as I was able.
30911,R3ID034556,2021-10-15T12:18:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it for myself and did receive it.
30913,R3ID034556,2021-11-10T10:34:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it. Feel fine with it.
30917,R3ID034558,2021-06-09T11:54:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
30919,R3ID034559,2021-06-10T07:19:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't know enough about it. I feel like anytime I look up information if I look long enough I can usually find opposite answers from different sources. I feel like it was rushed.  I worry about about long term side effects some may have.  When I see information on the companies that provide these vaccines it worries me even more that money came before care of the people over all.   I homeschool my two youngest and my oldest who is away at college is now fully vaccinated. I don't have a large social circle so I feel that I do a great job protecting me and my family.
30932,R3ID034575,2021-09-15T20:42:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I didnt want to get it but i will before my kids have to
30944,R3ID034581,2021-12-14T14:47:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Well it looks like the effectiveness seems like it is doing well. I personally always hated putting things in my body. I will have to do more research before I consider taking it.
30947,R3ID034582,2021-06-10T17:51:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"Still don't trust it. Fixed older vacvines like HPV before telling me a vaccine developed, produced and out in 3 months is safe. When the other has been around for 15+ years and its worse vaccine out."
30948,R3ID034582,2021-07-08T23:18:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I myself don't think I can trust it since we don't know the effects of the vaccine in the long term
30949,R3ID034582,2021-10-14T10:44:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel its everyone's choice. I have been fully vaccinated to help myself and my loved ones
30951,R3ID034582,2021-11-12T09:11:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I was waiting it out a little more to see how many more people reacted to the vaccine but since symptoms stayed relatively the same with hardly any side effects except mild symptoms I did decide to go get my vaccine.
30953,R3ID034595,2021-04-15T18:16:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it for myself and will likely get it for my child
30954,R3ID034595,2021-07-07T09:41:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m hopeful it will end this
30955,R3ID034595,2021-09-15T13:13:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"Adults in our house have recieved it, it?s been tested and we feel it is safe when recommended by our trusted doctors"
30957,R3ID034595,2021-11-10T13:21:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Have gotten it
30959,R3ID034597,2021-03-17T10:10:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it yet. I have heard if you have an autoimmune disease you could have a significant flare up. So due to me missing a lot of work I will not take it just yet.
30962,R3ID034602,2021-06-09T09:06:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Iffy
30965,R3ID034603,2021-09-17T09:35:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine, but i would like more data before vaccinating my children"
30972,R3ID034605,2021-06-09T21:06:18Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe yet. Not approved by the FDA
30974,R3ID034608,2021-11-10T15:39:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I 100% believe in its safety and efficacy. I have been fully vaccinated and look forward to the opportunity to get boosted!
30976,R3ID034609,2021-07-09T12:23:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerned about side effects and the ability to care for my kids

30983,R3ID034610,2021-07-08T21:06:31Z,NA,NA,NA,One of the first to have received it in Dec '20
30989,R3ID034611,2021-05-12T19:56:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it has been well researched and the benefit outweighs the very small risks for adults.
30992,R3ID034611,2021-09-17T05:33:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and believe it is safe and effective.
30993,R3ID034611,2021-10-14T14:41:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and I already have it
30996,R3ID034612,2021-06-10T06:16:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it and will not give it to my children. The information that is available about the vaccine is extremely misleading and I believe we will see negative effects of the vaccine in the next few years
31000,R3ID034612,2021-09-15T13:47:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not think it is safe, it is proving to create issues short term and we have no info on long term effects,  it is not proving to be effective at stopping the spread of Covid. I have no plan to get the vaccine"
31003,R3ID034615,2021-07-07T09:38:57Z,NA,NA,NA,The vaccine is safe and effective. I am vaccinated and so is my husband. I will get the children vaccinated as soon as they are able to be.
31007,R3ID034616,2021-05-12T08:17:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is effective. I will get it. My husband already has.
31009,R3ID034616,2021-07-07T09:16:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I tried to get the J&J vaccine but was denied due to health condition. I can only take the vaccine in a controlled environment like a health care provider clinic.
31010,R3ID034616,2021-11-10T10:10:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it's effective. My husband and son have been vaccinated. I was denied a vaccine at a non-medical location due to previous issues and conditions. I haven't gotten one yet.
31012,R3ID034618,2021-06-09T09:11:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received it , am weary for children."
31015,R3ID034618,2021-11-15T14:57:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it I do worry about my children?s fertility as it has changed my cycle (known issues due to vaccine)
31016,R3ID034618,2021-12-08T11:44:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel safe getting it but was more weary for my children

31415,R3ID034800,2021-10-14T11:56:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm unsure about it and will not be getting it
31416,R3ID034802,2021-07-07T13:54:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe the COVID vaccine is safe & effective. Any potential risks are dwarfed by the enormous threat to personal & public health that COVID poses. I got the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, and I will have my children do the same."
31420,R3ID034802,2021-12-08T09:33:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I strongly feel that the vaccine is safe, and that it is effective enough to warrant getting. I know that it may not prevent me from getting sick or spreading the virus, but it will dramatically decrease my chance of severe illness. I have already gotten my booster and just scheduled my husband's booster today. My kids will get the shot as soon as it is available to them."
31422,R3ID034806,2021-07-07T08:13:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fine with it, a little concerned about getting it for my child, until we know long term impacts."
31424,R3ID034806,2021-10-13T08:24:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I felt safe and got it

31427,R3ID034808,2021-06-10T19:11:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already received it and would like to get it for my children ASAP
31428,R3ID034808,2021-07-07T11:14:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. It's amazingly effective and relatively safe
31430,R3ID034808,2021-09-15T17:20:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is safe and effective as any other vaccine, and I have already received two doses of moderna"
31431,R3ID034808,2021-10-16T16:57:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and effective as any other vaccine and I have received both doses.
31435,R3ID034811,2021-07-08T13:29:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safety - probably about as safe as most other vaccines. Effectiveness - the numbers say 85%+ (depending on which vaccine you get), but really, I?m not sure I believe that number. We know there are a lot of people that still get COVID but they ?don?t get it as badly?. Although how are they classifying ?as badly? I think is a fair question. Plans to receive vaccine - nope. You have no clue what long term side effects are and on top of that I?m pregnant. That?s not a risk I?m willing to take. We also have no clue the affect of the vaccine on future fertility."
31441,R3ID034812,2021-04-15T12:52:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and it?s predictable as the moderna follows typical mRNA vaccines
31442,R3ID034812,2021-05-12T15:49:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe
31453,R3ID034822,2021-07-09T14:28:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Alread got it
31457,R3ID034823,2021-04-14T08:37:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine back in January, so I'm pretty gung-ho about it. We tried to sign up the baby for the trial for his age group, but we don't live in the right area"
31459,R3ID034823,2021-05-12T10:46:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already gotten it - I hope it's approved soon for children under 2
31461,R3ID034823,2021-09-16T09:30:10Z,NA,NA,NA,we have gotten the vaccine
31463,R3ID034823,2021-12-08T10:25:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Omicron has got me not feeling sanguine. I'm at a loss at how to keep protecting myself and my child from this.
31466,R3ID034825,2021-03-17T09:12:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it's safety and effectiveness and will get it when it is avaialble to me
31467,R3ID034825,2021-04-14T09:03:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safe and effective. I already have my first vaccine and scheduled to get my 2nd later this week

31478,R3ID034829,2021-04-14T09:12:39Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s too soon to tell the long term effectiveness. I will not get it at this point.
31480,R3ID034829,2021-05-12T08:15:08Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s hard because we do not know the long term effects of the vaccine
31482,R3ID034829,2021-06-09T10:28:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting because we don?t know the long term effects of the vaccine
31484,R3ID034829,2021-07-07T09:17:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"It might be safe as of now, but no one can predict the long term effects, if any. So, at this point I will not be getting it"
31489,R3ID034829,2021-09-16T16:20:25Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s difficult to know if there will be any long term effects. I most likely will not get it.

31493,R3ID034829,2021-11-10T18:34:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"At this point I will not get the vaccine. There is no way of knowing the long term impact of it. I am willing to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, boosting my immune system and testing regularly."
31495,R3ID034829,2021-12-08T13:50:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"At this point, I will not get it. I do not know the long term effects or impact it could have in the distant future."
31496,R3ID034830,2021-04-14T07:34:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am still a little concerned about the safety long term of the vaccine. I would like to get it, but I feel like more studies need to be done on the long term effects."
31498,R3ID034830,2021-10-17T06:42:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I still have some reservations about the vaccine and it?s effectiveness

31525,R3ID034837,2021-11-10T13:38:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it is effective enough, like the flu vaccine. I'm unsure of its safety. Yes, generally, healthy people who get it are ""safe."" But there has been no true long term research of the effects in people. I also have known 2 otherwise healthy individuals with serious side effects most likely as a result of the vaccine. One being a double pulmonary embolism with lung tissue death, the other being consistent high blood pressure, heart rate, heart problems in general.
I do not plan to get the vaccine."
31526,R3ID034837,2021-12-10T13:33:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"It seems effective. Not sure about safety. personally know two otherwise people who had life threatening side effects from it. 
I will not get it."

31538,R3ID034840,2021-09-17T08:07:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine because i dont want to suffer through covid again
31541,R3ID034841,2021-06-09T11:03:56Z,NA,NA,NA,More than likely very safe and effective for adults.  I do not intend to get it
31544,R3ID034841,2021-09-15T08:04:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Probably safe and fairly effective.  Not planning to get it at this time as i have natural immunity so i am already protected and am a little concerned bc i am breastfeeding
31546,R3ID034841,2021-12-08T09:22:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is safe and that there is no scientific reason why it should be dangerous.  Also the benefits usually outweigh the risks.  My husband has gotten the vaccine in addition to having natural immunity from having COVID.  I do not plan on getting the vaccine until I have completely weaned my son.  I understand that I can pass immunity through my breast milk but I am just kind of nervous about the long-term unintended side effects or consequences that there might be on a developing child.  There have been no longitudinal studies because the vaccine is still so new.  I am not anti-vaccine in general or some kind of nut, but I just think in the case of my son and me, the very slim risks outweigh the even slimmer benefits.  A member of my family had very serious long-term side effects from a medicine his mother was given while she was pregnant that seemed safe and evidence-based in the short-term.  Also my son and I have both had COVID and so we have some natural immunity."
31547,R3ID034843,2021-03-18T12:14:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerned about the efficiency against new strains but will receive the vaccine when I am eligible in my state
31551,R3ID034847,2021-04-14T14:16:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm getting the Pfizer vaccine this month and my husband got his a couple months ago. I'm a little worried about the long term effects but overall I feel it is safe
31553,R3ID034847,2021-06-09T10:13:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the moderna vaccine. Unsure how I feel for giving it to my child

31560,R3ID034849,2021-09-15T08:45:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective and already have both shots will get booster if needed
31563,R3ID034850,2021-12-12T09:50:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. I?ve already gotten it and my of age (5) child has had his first dose with his second scheduled
31566,R3ID034853,2021-09-15T12:46:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"I like it, it?s proving its helpful"

31585,R3ID034859,2021-11-10T09:10:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm not getting it. I don't think it's safe for me, my unborn, or for the rest of my family. I also don't think it's very effective since you can still contract and pass the virus."
31587,R3ID034859,2021-12-14T15:55:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it. They don't know the long term effects.

31605,R3ID034866,2021-09-15T11:10:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it.
31606,R3ID034866,2021-11-10T17:26:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I think its safe for an adult. We've gotten the Johnson and Johnson one back in March and have been protected. I sway on whether I'd vaccine my youngest at under 2 years old.
31608,R3ID034866,2021-12-08T10:20:26Z,NA,NA,NA,All vaccines are throughly researched and trialed before distribution. I already received it.
31612,R3ID034874,2021-05-14T13:50:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not want to get it until more long term data is available
31619,R3ID034876,2021-05-12T11:07:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am vaccinated. mRNA vaccines appear very effective against both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. I am concerned about safety in children, and how it will affect immune response to covid in years to come."

Based on PNAS study planning to wait until 3rd trimester (less fever risk compared to first trimester and prelim signal that immunity is passed to neonate which is important because trials unlikely to go earlier than 6m old children)."
31637,R3ID034884,2021-11-14T12:56:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received the 2 doses as has my husband. I do not have plans for a booster as it seemed to really make my auto-immune disorders worse at that time.
31640,R3ID034885,2021-07-07T12:32:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Not enough testing. We will not be getting the vaccine until it is fully FDA tested and approved.

31666,R3ID034888,2021-09-16T09:43:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont think its a vaccine as it doesnt prevent illness and modifies dna chain. On a religious stance I will never get the vaccine.

31725,R3ID034914,2021-04-14T07:07:50Z,NA,NA,NA,We will never get it. Its an experiment that is unnecessary (99.97% recover from CV). It seems ineffective and dangerous more so than others. All vaccines have serious side effects that companies arent liable for! I would rather live a healthy lifestyle and know how tonsupport my immune system than live in fear.
31726,R3ID034914,2021-05-12T08:12:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe or effective.  We will never get it.

However, I did choose to get it (basically as soon as I was able to - in Jan/Feb 2021) because I was breastfeeding my youngest and knew I could give some passive immunity to Covid through getting vaccinated. And since I was still breastfeeding when she turned 1 I chose to get the booster also two months ago. I do not plan on getting my children the Covid vaccine however, I am not comfortable with that and I do not think it?s necessary as kids aren?t getting very sick with Covid."
31909,R3ID035022,2021-05-12T07:32:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Too early to determine side effects

31936,R3ID035046,2021-12-08T15:59:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I didn't really do research on my own. But got the vaccine right away and recently the booster because honestly I hate being sick. In my mind its like the flu shot but I'm sure there is more to it than that.

32149,R3ID035589,2021-11-10T09:36:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure how I feel about it
32152,R3ID035592,2021-05-13T16:46:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine already but at first I was iffy about it.
32155,R3ID035608,2021-04-15T14:38:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Not good
32156,R3ID035608,2021-06-11T11:54:53Z,NA,NA,NA,We are not planning to get it
32165,R3ID035635,2021-04-14T07:14:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I actually got the vaccine already and got it to provide safety for my child

32169,R3ID035635,2021-07-09T18:42:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already
32174,R3ID035635,2021-09-15T10:58:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I did receive the vaccine because I am at risk while working outside of my home and I did not want to bring it to my baby. I think for now, future side effects are worth chancing because covid is killing thousands."
32176,R3ID035635,2021-10-13T10:55:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I amm vaccinated hoping to be protected by the COVID virus. I am afraid for my young child who is unable to be vaccinated at this time.
32178,R3ID035635,2021-12-08T09:56:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Concerned about the future side effects but I had to get it to feel safe at work since I?m around clients all day. I wanted to keep my child safe.
32181,R3ID035565,2021-03-18T12:06:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the vaccine may be effective but in my opinion it has not been out long enough to see long-term results. I don?t plan on getting the vaccine for awhile because I feel like the vaccine could have some side affects.
32183,R3ID035565,2021-06-09T15:01:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to see the side affects of the vaccine long term so I will be waiting a couple years to receive the vaccine .

32228,R3ID035175,2021-03-17T09:49:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"If it becomes a required vaccine for school, I will get it with my kids"
32231,R3ID035175,2021-09-15T11:15:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Still waiting and researching it. I?m undecided on wether or not I will get it
32236,R3ID035178,2021-09-16T10:19:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"While I do believe their may be some side effects that may yet be understood, the virus far outweighs any of them. Everyone eligible in my household got the vx as soon as it was available to us."
32237,R3ID035180,2021-04-14T11:34:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think it has been out long enough to do all the proper testing.

32247,R3ID035183,2021-12-11T21:30:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Not for me and my family at this time. Too new and the survival rate for Covid is too high. We protect ourselves in other ways and have antibodies from having the actual virus last year.
32251,R3ID035187,2021-07-08T13:46:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe and am now fully vaccinated

32265,R3ID035192,2021-03-17T13:26:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"Definitely not enough safety tests, because there's no way they know the long term effects.   Could it cause a cancer epidemic in five to ten years?  We don't yet know its true effectiveness.  No plans to get it."
32266,R3ID035192,2021-04-15T13:17:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not enough long term safety data (10 or more years, long term effects)"

32270,R3ID035192,2021-09-16T12:54:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure how safe or effective it is.  Data keeps changing so not sure yet.
32272,R3ID035192,2021-10-13T17:00:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I think more long term studies need to be done.  Not getting it right now.  I want to see it?s efficacy overtime with variants too.
32274,R3ID035192,2021-11-10T17:05:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure about the long term safety and it?s ever changing efficacy.  Also rare documented side effects.  I don?t plan to get it any time soon.

32341,R3ID035224,2021-12-14T12:42:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get the vaccine as I feel that it is too new and has not gone through a long enough approval process. We don't know any long term side effects yet and there are deaths and side effects happening that are not always being reported in the MSM.
32343,R3ID035225,2021-04-15T13:48:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe to receive. I received my first dose of Moderna in March and am scheduled for my second dose next week.

32597,R3ID035357,2021-06-10T20:45:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not enough research, we will wait, we already had Covid-19"
32603,R3ID035361,2021-04-14T09:39:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s very safe and I already got both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
32606,R3ID035361,2021-12-12T11:04:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it?s very safe and effective. My whole family, including my 5 year old, is now vaccinated."
32614,R3ID035365,2021-03-18T12:15:03Z,NA,NA,NA,All ready received
32620,R3ID035366,2021-05-12T09:46:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel pretty confident in it. I went back and forth on if I should receive it during pregnancy but ultimately decided having protection for myself and the unborn baby before going into the hospital was a benefit that outweighed the risks. I received my first dose at 32 weeks and second at 35.
32621,R3ID035366,2021-06-09T11:27:42Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have received it and I love that some protection was passed onto my daughter in utero. I?m nervous about getting it for my toddler though.
32622,R3ID035366,2021-09-15T16:01:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the benefits outweigh the risks. I received it while pregnant and my newborn is healthy. My husband has also received it.
32625,R3ID035367,2021-03-19T12:47:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it
32626,R3ID035367,2021-04-14T07:30:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it
32627,R3ID035367,2021-06-09T08:56:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure about it yet
32628,R3ID035368,2021-05-13T14:52:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it but still worried about long term affects.
32630,R3ID035368,2021-11-10T10:11:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been vaccinated. I am not ready to vaccinate my child yet I would like to have more long term effects known before giving it to my children.
32634,R3ID035370,2021-05-12T09:09:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received it. I believe it is safe and hope it is effective.
32635,R3ID035370,2021-07-07T16:42:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe
32643,R3ID035374,2021-04-14T10:02:00Z,NA,NA,NA,It is tested science and hopefully it is safe. I have received the first vaccine.
32644,R3ID035374,2021-10-13T12:01:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safe and the science has been around for awhile. I was vaccinated while pregnant to protect myself and baby.
32645,R3ID035374,2021-11-10T09:28:27Z,NA,NA,NA,After doing research I felt like it was backed by science and was eager to receive so form of protection against the virus.
32649,R3ID035378,2021-09-15T09:32:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as possible. I trust science. I will get it for my son the first day I can.
32652,R3ID035378,2021-12-08T09:04:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated with a booster. I think we should trust the science and everyone should get it as soon as possible. I want to get it for my son as soon as he?s eligible.
32658,R3ID035380,2021-11-14T10:32:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received the vaccine and believe in its ability to help protect me from getting dangerously ill.
32660,R3ID035382,2021-10-16T12:51:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got it, fully, my hole family did"
32661,R3ID035384,2021-12-08T09:55:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to receive the covid vaccine until proven safe and effective.
32662,R3ID035385,2021-11-10T09:45:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am concerned for the safety in children. I am fine with it for adults. I do not yet have it because I just haven't made the time to get it and I have little incentive. I am not concerned for my personal health since I have already had Covid-19 as well as all my family members and we recovered fine. I would still have to wear a mask even if I were to be vaccinated because I have young children who cannot be vaccinated. I can't expect them to wear a mask if I am not wearing one. So I have no problem with the vaccine I just don't see a need for me to take time from my busy schedule to get one at this time. 

My children are all under 5 with the exception of one who is 5. However my 5 year old is very petite and is smaller than her 3 year old sister. This causes me to feel that the vaccine is not safe for her because if it isn't safe for her younger yet bigger sister I do not feel it is safe for her."
32668,R3ID035387,2021-11-12T12:47:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I've gotten the vaccine and have plans to get the booster. In my mind, any small risk in the vaccine itself is far outweighed by the risks of contracting the coronavirus, and any resulting complications."
32671,R3ID035389,2021-07-07T08:49:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't plan on getting it unless i have to. Concerned about safety and long term effects of a new vaccine
32675,R3ID035391,2021-04-14T08:08:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Planning to get it
32676,R3ID035391,2021-05-14T05:17:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
32679,R3ID035391,2021-11-15T06:17:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
32685,R3ID035392,2021-03-17T09:04:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not getting it too many issues with people with side effects. It is like your taking a gamble.
32687,R3ID035392,2021-04-15T07:50:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not interested
32689,R3ID035392,2021-05-12T07:38:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not getting the vaccine or my family. At this time we are going to watch and see in the news.
32691,R3ID035392,2021-06-09T09:18:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I am still holding off on getting the vaccine.
32693,R3ID035392,2021-07-07T11:28:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not getting the vaccine yet due to safety
32698,R3ID035392,2021-09-15T14:27:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine.
32700,R3ID035392,2021-10-13T09:03:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the shot and I had no choice but to get it.
32702,R3ID035392,2021-11-10T09:39:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and not sure if I am happy about it. I have rashes that I am not sure came from it or not.
32704,R3ID035392,2021-12-08T10:32:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the vaccine and I hope that haven?t caused these rashes I have been getting on arms
32708,R3ID035394,2021-07-08T10:25:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Too new and experimental. My family had covid with little to no symptoms or side effects. Not worth the risk to vaccinate them for an illness that poses no danger to them.
32711,R3ID035395,2021-04-15T15:16:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not feel safe,, we will not be getting it"
32714,R3ID035395,2021-12-08T09:47:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like hat it was rushed and is not safe

32725,R3ID035401,2021-04-16T12:46:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am unsure of it because of the technology used to make it.  I am for vaccines that have been around and been tested, but I am unsure of this one."
32732,R3ID035404,2021-03-18T12:16:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it as soon as I qualify and can get an appointment
32735,R3ID035404,2021-09-17T08:08:01Z,NA,NA,NA,The adults we associate with are vaccinated. We feel it is effective protection to a point
32736,R3ID035404,2021-10-13T15:38:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it and am vaccinated.
32739,R3ID035406,2021-07-07T09:31:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I have it and I stand behind the science that created it.
32744,R3ID035407,2021-07-07T09:00:07Z,NA,NA,NA,We are fully vaccinated
32748,R3ID035408,2021-12-14T12:49:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Worried about how much it is being politicized. Makes it less appealing even to pro vaccine people who don't trust politicians. It should be left to the medical community to talk about it.
32753,R3ID035411,2021-06-09T10:06:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been vaccinated. It is safe
32759,R3ID035413,2021-12-12T11:51:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and effective. I have received both doses of the vaccine
32762,R3ID035414,2021-04-14T11:08:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe won't be getting it
32763,R3ID035414,2021-09-15T08:21:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe. Not getting.

32767,R3ID035421,2021-11-14T09:43:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm unsure and not ready to get it yet

My mom and sisters family have the vaccine- except my dad hasn?t gotten any vaccines. We?ve felt comfortable with getting them but out more importance on good hygiene and social distancing/masking
32781,R3ID035425,2021-05-13T07:45:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm fully vax and happy to be so.
32786,R3ID035428,2021-07-07T14:16:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have it, but unsure about giving it to our child"
32789,R3ID035428,2021-11-10T10:24:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it may save my life. I already got it.
32790,R3ID035429,2021-04-14T07:15:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm glad it exists. I've already gotten both doses. I signed up for them as soon as I was eligible
32792,R3ID035429,2021-06-10T08:24:35Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband was part of the vaccine trial and I was an educator. We both got our vaccines as early as possible and plan the get the kids vaccinated as soon as their age groups are able/allowed to.
32794,R3ID035429,2021-07-07T08:09:36Z,NA,NA,NA,It seems effective and I've already gotten it
32798,R3ID035430,2021-06-10T09:51:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaxxed.  My kids will get the vaccine when it?s allowed for their age

32805,R3ID035431,2021-07-08T09:17:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"Such a relief, we've already gotten it"
32810,R3ID035434,2021-05-12T09:10:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Hesitant
32813,R3ID035434,2021-09-15T18:31:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it because I have to
32814,R3ID035434,2021-12-10T08:11:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure for my children. I am required to get it

32839,R3ID035439,2021-10-13T15:08:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective
32841,R3ID035439,2021-11-10T10:10:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"COVID vaccine for adults is very safe and very effective, already received. I question its necessity for children, as they have not been an age group to become extremely ill or to be  widespread transmitters."
32843,R3ID035439,2021-12-08T19:55:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"Vaccines do not necessarily guard against infection, but very much protect against hospitalization and death."
32849,R3ID035444,2021-03-17T09:09:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe that it is safe. It seems more effective than the flu shot, which is something my entire family gets every year. I plan to get the vaccine when it is my turn."
32850,R3ID035444,2021-04-14T07:16:42Z,NA,NA,NA,The J&J shot is starting to give me pause because of the blood clot issue. The other two seem safe and mostly effective. I have known two people to get COVID after vaccination. I plan to get my shot(s) when it's my turn.
32852,R3ID035444,2021-05-12T07:12:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scheduled to get my first dose this month. I think it is safe and mostly effective. The variants add a new layer of challenge.

32868,R3ID035447,2021-04-15T13:32:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I will get my first dose within the next few weeks. I'm not 100% convinced of it's safety and efficacy, but I think the benefits outweigh the risks."
32869,R3ID035447,2021-09-15T11:42:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have some concerns, but feel like the benefits outweigh the risks for Moderna and Pfizer, at least for adults. I am unsure if the benefits outweigh risks for children. My mother had a probable severe reaction to Johnson & Johnson (they cannot prove the vaccine caused it, but believe it is the probable cause), so am more hesitant and discourage friends from getting the J&J shot."
32870,R3ID035447,2021-10-13T11:00:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got it. I'm not 100% convinced of it's safety and efficacy, but the benefits outweighed the disadvantages in my case."
32871,R3ID035447,2021-11-10T10:07:51Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have already gotten it. We believe that benefits outweigh the disadvantages of the vaccine for most adults. We are unconvinced that the benefits would outweigh the disadvantages for our kids.

32905,R3ID035465,2021-07-09T16:59:33Z,NA,NA,NA,At this time i am not comfortable getting the vaccine or giving it to my children.  There are still too many variables and unknowns.
32911,R3ID035466,2021-05-12T07:34:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that in general it seems to be fairly safe so far, and the effectiveness seems pretty high. I have gotten my first dose of the vaccine last month and am scheduled to receive the second dose this month."
32913,R3ID035466,2021-06-10T09:24:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it. I feel that it should be relatively safe and that it has been determined to be pretty effective.
32915,R3ID035466,2021-07-07T08:20:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the benefits of it outweigh the potential risks and that the vaccine is crucial in establishing a herd immunity and getting our country back to a level of normalcy. I have already received the vaccine
32918,R3ID035466,2021-09-15T08:31:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine, while being new, was tested well to make sure it was safe and the effectiveness of it seems to be good overall. I think that it is better to have it than to risk getting the virus. I have already received my vaccine."
32921,R3ID035466,2021-11-10T11:06:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten the vaccine, because I felt that the benefits of it outweighed the risk of any side effects. I believe that in order to get COVID-19 under control, we need to develop a herd immunity."
32923,R3ID035466,2021-12-10T08:07:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten the vaccine because in my opinion, the benefits of having it outweigh the risks, and I heard that the long term effects of getting covid could be very serious so I think that the vaccine is the best option."
32925,R3ID035467,2021-06-09T10:56:51Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are fully vaccinated but don?t plan to risk the miserable side effects on our kids who are likely to have a light case if they ever were to get it?
32927,R3ID035467,2021-09-15T12:31:22Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have both been vaccinated.
32928,R3ID035467,2021-11-10T11:59:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had 3 rounds of Moderna and my Husband 2 rounds. Still debating on my 7 year old as she has been known to have high fevers with routine vaccines?
32933,R3ID035470,2021-04-14T08:30:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel its very safe and I will get my first dose later this month, as will my husband."

32951,R3ID035475,2021-09-15T09:52:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it helps and I?m vaccinated
32955,R3ID035477,2021-07-09T15:43:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it
32959,R3ID035480,2021-03-17T10:36:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, got it"
32960,R3ID035480,2021-04-15T17:24:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe
32962,R3ID035480,2021-06-10T11:34:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"Have it, hope it works well"
32969,R3ID035482,2021-09-17T10:27:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"It?s safe but not 100% effective which is why it?s still important to wear masks, wash hands and social distance. I?ve already gotten it and plan to get the booster when it?s made available."
32973,R3ID035483,2021-07-07T09:26:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I get my 2nd dose today
32974,R3ID035483,2021-09-17T08:01:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received both doses. I am concerned about the amount of testing but spoke to a friend who is employed within scientific research and she was able to reassure me.
32979,R3ID035484,2021-04-15T14:47:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received both doses of Pfizer
32980,R3ID035484,2021-05-12T20:27:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have gotten it
32984,R3ID035484,2021-11-12T09:52:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, my husband has it, and my eligible child had had his first dose. My younger children will get it as soon as they are eligible. I trust the scientific community."
32986,R3ID035486,2021-11-11T11:31:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have concerns about the long term effectiveness of the vaccine and about the long term side effects. My husband and I were both diagnosed with Covid after receiving the vaccine. We both got the vaccine as soon as we could because in the short term, we need to be as healthy as we can and provide for our child. I do not have plans to vaccinate my child at this point though."
32990,R3ID035487,2021-11-10T19:54:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe and I got it
32992,R3ID035500,2021-03-17T16:07:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m sure it?s safe/effective, and I will be getting it when available for my family & I."
32993,R3ID035500,2021-06-09T13:14:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"Getting it soon, feel it?s safe"
32994,R3ID035500,2021-12-14T08:23:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s very safe. I have received the first two doses of Pfizer
32996,R3ID035502,2021-06-09T10:20:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think it's safe and you don't plan to get hurt
32997,R3ID035502,2021-10-13T14:26:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I still have concerns about the safety of vaccines but I am partially vaccinated and going to get my second vaccine soon
32998,R3ID035505,2021-04-14T10:01:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan on getting it. It was hurried through production and I do not think it is safe. There is no way of knowing how harmful long term effects it might have.
33000,R3ID035509,2021-04-14T09:32:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the first dose and am scheduled for the second. I'm nervous about the long term effects, but trust that they'll be safer than getting covid."
33004,R3ID035510,2021-07-07T19:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have it and feel confident in its safety
33007,R3ID035511,2021-05-13T03:07:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it
33008,R3ID035511,2021-06-09T09:18:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten both doses and am thrilled. It has really helped ease my mind a bit and reduce anxiety. I?m still being very careful, though, because of course my little girl can?t get vaccinated."
33023,R3ID035518,2021-06-10T08:02:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it.
33026,R3ID035521,2021-06-09T09:48:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, I think it is safe and effective"
33027,R3ID035521,2021-07-09T06:52:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it

33030,R3ID035521,2021-10-13T12:21:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
33033,R3ID035523,2021-09-16T08:12:36Z,NA,NA,NA,It's better than getting Covid for adults.
33035,R3ID035524,2021-04-14T08:09:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is relatively safe. I have already received both doses of the Moderna vaccine.
33036,R3ID035524,2021-06-09T08:15:03Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have confidence in its safety and effectiveness, and have already been fully vaccinated."
33038,R3ID035524,2021-07-09T17:25:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. I am fully vaccinated.
33040,R3ID035524,2021-09-17T09:27:45Z,NA,NA,NA,It is relatively safe and effective in mitigating severe symptoms and death. I am fully vaccinated.
33041,R3ID035524,2021-12-10T10:22:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe the vaccines are relatively safe and effective. Their benefits outweigh the risks of possible side effects. I am fully vaccinated, including booster, as are all eligible adults and children in my household."
33045,R3ID035526,2021-06-09T15:23:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, will always recommend"
33047,R3ID035526,2021-11-12T11:04:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and is our way out of the pandemic. I have already received my 3rd booster and just vaccinated my child that met the new age requirements.
33048,R3ID035526,2021-12-08T14:58:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Its safe and is our way out of the pandemic. I trust science.
33054,R3ID035527,2021-05-12T08:22:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it and have received both shots
33055,R3ID035527,2021-06-09T09:40:54Z,NA,NA,NA,Positive. And fully Vaccinated
33059,R3ID035528,2021-03-17T12:58:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"My plan is to get it, but I am nervous about longterm effects. The fact that is was declared safe, when phase one testing won't be completed until May, let alone phase 3 is concerning."
33062,R3ID035528,2021-06-10T08:15:07Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both already fully vaccinated. Although I had my reservations at first I'm choosing to trust science and not the talking heads and conspiracy theorists.
33063,R3ID035528,2021-07-07T08:49:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I already recieved both doses.  As for my child, she's only 12 months old, so it will be a while before it's approved for babies. I think I would want full FDA approval, not just emergency approval for her to get it."
33064,R3ID035528,2021-09-15T08:39:28Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both vaccinated and it's infuriating that so many people are refusing the vaccine.
33067,R3ID035529,2021-09-15T11:22:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel safe and have already gotten it.
33070,R3ID035530,2021-07-07T08:16:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I was not planning on getting the vaccine initially due to lack of side effect information and long term effects. I have recieved the first dose within the past week in hopes to protect my family as much as possible
33071,R3ID035531,2021-03-18T12:31:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel a little hesitance because of the rate of side effects but we plan to get it
33073,R3ID035532,2021-04-14T09:38:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe or hope it works i already have it
33074,R3ID035532,2021-05-13T13:12:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Already have it
33078,R3ID035539,2021-07-08T21:21:39Z,NA,NA,NA,We will get it as soon as available for kids
33080,R3ID035539,2021-09-16T22:24:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"We are all vaxxed if permitted, kids ASAP"
33081,R3ID035541,2021-03-19T12:50:02Z,NA,NA,NA,We will not be getting it. It has only been approved for emergency use. It has not been fully tested for any long term effects. It does not prevent you from contracting the virus or spreading it.
33089,R3ID035543,2021-05-12T20:30:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident in it. I have received my first dose.
33090,R3ID035543,2021-06-10T08:07:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated
33091,R3ID035543,2021-07-07T09:18:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated
33099,R3ID035544,2021-11-10T09:05:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m Leary of it?s effectiveness present and long term side effects
33103,R3ID035640,2021-03-19T12:45:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure on safety and effectiveness since it is still new. Will not get vaccine until more research shows long term effects.
33106,R3ID035640,2021-07-07T08:15:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I have not done enough research to form an official opinion. Have not gotten the vaccine yet. Will wait until I have more info
33109,R3ID035642,2021-09-17T10:14:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve already gotten it. I feel it is worth it to get and I believe it is effective at reducing risk of hospitalization or death due to covid.
33116,R3ID035647,2021-04-14T21:38:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to wait a little longer before deciding if I will get it
33117,R3ID035647,2021-05-13T10:12:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"There are a lot of unknows about it, I will likely get it at some point."
33119,R3ID035647,2021-06-09T15:36:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Seems ok
33123,R3ID035648,2021-05-12T14:11:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"We believe it?s worth getting. Both my husband and I have had the shot, Pfizer and Moderna. We are a little more hesitant for the kids until there is better research, but open to it."
33125,R3ID035650,2021-07-09T01:11:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve gotten it for my elders. I probably won?t get the yearly updates
33127,R3ID035651,2021-06-09T09:02:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it unsure if my kids will due to daughter's allergies
33136,R3ID035653,2021-12-08T13:55:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"Both husband and I are boosted, our 1 year old is in vaccine trial and 3 year old is on a waitlist for vaccine trial. We believe in science and know vaccines greatly reduce a chance of severely being sick."
33139,R3ID035654,2021-10-16T22:20:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I just got the 1st dose, I had to hold off due to medical reasons. I am for anything that has a chance at protecting you but I?m worried about long term effects since it?s new, I also don?t know what to believe since this has become so political when it shouldn?t be"
33140,R3ID035654,2021-11-15T23:24:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I just received it because I feel like any protection is good because you do not know how your body will react to the virus. I also am worried about long term effects.
33144,R3ID035655,2021-11-10T21:06:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I think that it is safe and effective for adults. I do not think there is enough information on the long term effects on children. My husband and I have been vaccinated.
33145,R3ID035655,2021-12-14T17:09:06Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have both been vaccinated. We have not had boosters yet. I am hopeful it will protect our young son so that he doesn?t get sick and if we get sick it won?t be as bad. I am also pregnant now and I feel better knowing I have done what I can to protect myself and my baby.
33148,R3ID035660,2021-06-10T23:08:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't plan on getting it. I don't think it's necessary.
33159,R3ID035673,2021-06-09T10:09:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Skeptical about long term side effects if any
33164,R3ID035673,2021-09-15T21:06:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I was skeptical about not knowing long term side effects if any but decided it was worth the risk versus going unvaccinated so I got vaccinated in July. I feel it may not completely keep you from getting the virus but lessens the severity of you do get the virus
33166,R3ID035673,2021-11-14T16:10:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"I reluctantly got both my doses in June and July 2021 after an exposure to someone that was positive. We ended up being negative but that scare along with us traveling this summer convinced me to get it. I feel with my age (47), there are some health risks that aren?t known yet that I don?t have to worry about such as effects on future pregnancies. If I were younger and still trying for kids I would definitely be more hesitant. I feel it?s relatively safe and I?m still social distancing and wearing a mask as much as possible to maximize my chances of not contracting it."
33169,R3ID035674,2021-10-14T12:45:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I just got my booster about a week ago. I feel EVERYONE WHO CAN should be getting the vaccine and there is no excuse at this point not to other then selfishness
33172,R3ID035675,2021-05-13T12:19:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scared of the unknown but did get it
33173,R3ID035675,2021-09-16T09:47:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Received but unsure of safety
33175,R3ID035677,2021-03-19T12:27:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m worried about it?s safety for children and pregnant women
33177,R3ID035677,2021-06-11T15:13:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m still deciding whether I should get it since I?m pregnant
33187,R3ID035681,2021-11-10T17:34:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Not receiving it
33192,R3ID035684,2021-11-10T12:11:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"It does not prevent transmission. Studies show that the effectiveness of the vaccine in producing neutralizing antibodies declines rapidly.  The original endpoint of the study was the insultingly low goal of reducing hospital admissions, and due to multiple problems with study design (failing to test symptomatic participants in the vaccine group, failure to double blind, etc) I do not believe the manufacturers' effectiveness claims are reliable. This coupled with a concerning number of reported injuries and deaths makes the decision easy.  I will not get the vaccine and neither will my children. At best it reduces symptoms, and my family has already had Covid with extremely mild symptoms that we recovered easily from. This entire virus has been ridiculously overblown and politicized. Any viewpoints not aligning with the official narrative (even those from medical professionals, virologists, pharmaceutical experts, and others qualified to speak) have been suppressed.  Hysterical cries about the number of deaths overlook similar or greater rates of death from preventable causes such as heart disease. Until we get hysterical about obesity, I don't see a reason to become hysterical over a virus that is now endemic."
33194,R3ID035685,2021-03-18T12:04:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"it is safe, I will get it"
33196,R3ID035685,2021-04-16T16:43:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already recieved it, I feel it is safe and effective"
33197,R3ID035685,2021-11-14T09:36:36Z,NA,NA,NA,My whole family has been vaccinated
33206,R3ID035687,2021-07-07T15:01:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel safe and effective. Already vaccinated

33219,R3ID035690,2021-04-14T07:04:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the first dose. I?m worried since I?ve been reading articles about adverse effects and if it does actually work.
33220,R3ID035690,2021-09-15T09:32:18Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it already but question how effective it really is
33221,R3ID035690,2021-10-13T10:56:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. Not sure how effective it is
33224,R3ID035693,2021-06-10T11:22:03Z,NA,NA,NA,My family will not get it. I am fearful that we as a society do not yet know what the long term affects could be.
33226,R3ID035693,2021-10-13T10:32:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel their is enough long term data to determine true safety and effectiveness. I do not plan to get the vaccine at this time.
33228,R3ID035693,2021-12-09T00:27:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"At this time, I do not feel there is enough research on the long term affects to feel comfortable taking it. I do not plan to get it any time in the near future."
33231,R3ID035695,2021-10-16T20:42:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"i believe it is safer to get the vaccine and lower my odds,  rather than take a chance"
33234,R3ID035697,2021-09-17T12:54:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not getting it, I?m currently trying to convince. I feel there are not enough studies out and it?s too new for me to be comfortable getting the vaccine."
33236,R3ID035698,2021-05-12T09:28:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it.
33237,R3ID035698,2021-06-09T09:19:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s fine. My children are still younger than 5 so I do t think I?ll have them get it until they understand what it?s for.
33240,R3ID035701,2021-07-07T09:05:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vaccine is safer than catching covid and it's effective against covid. That's why I'm vaccinated and will have my childrenvaccinated a soon as they can be.
33243,R3ID035705,2021-03-17T14:15:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Confident
33246,R3ID035710,2021-03-19T15:36:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I am about 75% surei will get it just worried about side effects

33255,R3ID035712,2021-07-07T11:21:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it and feel it is fairly safe
33257,R3ID035713,2021-03-17T16:38:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I am getting it.

33264,R3ID035720,2021-06-09T10:17:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Myself and my husband are fully vaccinated. Our children will be as eligibility is expanded.
33269,R3ID035722,2021-03-17T19:15:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Think it?s perfectly safe and plan to get it as soon as I?m able
33270,R3ID035722,2021-04-14T20:07:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it and have been vaccinated.
33274,R3ID035722,2021-12-08T12:40:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe but not very effective. I had my vaccination but won?t be getting a booster.
33292,R3ID035745,2021-12-09T08:32:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm concerned about it's safety and don't believe it's very effective. I know several people who have been vaccinated and later gotten Covid. I don't plan to get the vaccine at this time.
33301,R3ID035753,2021-06-09T09:04:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not be getting it. Notnenoughbis known about the long term effects
33302,R3ID035753,2021-12-08T11:04:58Z,NA,NA,NA,Im on the fence. But as of right now I will not be getting the vaccine

33308,R3ID035787,2021-05-12T07:29:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it - I got it and want my children to get it asap.
33310,R3ID035788,2021-04-15T04:05:19Z,NA,NA,NA,i feel it is safe and effective. i plan on getting it next month.
33316,R3ID035793,2021-04-15T13:26:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I am hoping it works. I already am vaccinated
33319,R3ID035793,2021-11-10T13:18:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it and got my family members to get it
33321,R3ID035793,2021-12-08T09:21:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and effective and I already got it
33324,R3ID035796,2021-05-12T12:02:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"Feel safe and effective enough to get it; the possible risk affect small percent of population and the benefit especially to those around us is big. Follow the recommendations and read through the clinical study. We didn?t want to jump the line to take the place for those who really need it first so we waited for our turn. When it opened, we got an appointment right away. We Already got first Moderna, getting second shot this week"
33326,R3ID035796,2021-12-14T09:44:01Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s safe and better than not having it even though it?s not effective 100% of the time. I am already fully vaccinated since mid May and recently got a booster. My older daughter who is 5.5 just got her first dose last week!
33329,R3ID035799,2021-11-12T15:30:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Neither my husband nor myself or our children will be getting the vaccine. The fact that so many health care professionals will quit their jobs before getting it is enough to tell me there is something wrong with it. We have no clue what the long term effects will be and I refuse to give it to my young children. Finally the entire situation from the past year (almost two) feels so wrong on a fundamental level, not just different but actually wrong that my instinct says the public is not being told something important and I don?t trust or believe any of what we have been told."
33330,R3ID035799,2021-12-12T16:50:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust the COVID-19 vaccine. I do not believe it to be safe or effective at all and I do not plan on ever getting the vaccine or giving it to my children.
33336,R3ID035801,2021-10-13T12:40:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I am already vaccinated.
33341,R3ID035802,2021-06-11T08:40:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
33348,R3ID035807,2021-04-14T11:09:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it
33354,R3ID035807,2021-09-16T08:19:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel very uneasy about it.
33355,R3ID035807,2021-11-14T16:30:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it as a pregnant person
33365,R3ID035810,2021-09-16T09:24:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"If the statistics given by hospitals, clinic, and the CDC are accurate, I believe the vaccine to be effective. I?ve been fully vaccinated for over 5 months and was not hesitant to receive the vaccine. I figured even if the vaccine doesn?t work, it?s worth a try. I would not have rushed getting the vaccine the way I did if I did not have a child who has moderate-to-severe asthma."
33374,R3ID035817,2021-04-16T12:14:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe.  I have gotten both vaccines
33380,R3ID035817,2021-10-13T09:11:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it And feel it is safe
33388,R3ID035820,2021-04-14T07:08:35Z,NA,NA,NA,"Definitely not getting it, they can't know how it will affect my fertility or that if my breastfed baby. Also no reason to for a virus with 99% survival rate!!"
33391,R3ID035820,2021-10-14T10:21:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not getting it, long term effects can?t be known yet"
33392,R3ID035820,2021-11-10T09:40:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it. Long term effects can?t be known yet
33393,R3ID035820,2021-12-08T20:25:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it! Don?t get any vaccines.
33397,R3ID035822,2021-06-09T21:09:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm all for it.  Going to get it after I'm done being pregnant
33410,R3ID035824,2021-04-14T11:36:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the research was already there and we're building on it so it is mostly safe.
33412,R3ID035824,2021-07-07T12:10:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe but jm holding off because of pregnancy
33416,R3ID035825,2021-03-17T08:46:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I think rhe vaccines are safe and i am scheduled to get one next week.
33418,R3ID035825,2021-09-16T08:22:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and effective. Already vaccinated
33419,R3ID035825,2021-10-14T10:19:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm vaccinated and thankful.
33425,R3ID035827,2021-07-07T09:19:20Z,NA,NA,NA,We have jt
33427,R3ID035828,2021-10-14T08:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in it and happy that i was able to get it
33428,R3ID035828,2021-11-11T20:31:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it and i am satisfied
33439,R3ID035833,2021-03-17T09:02:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to get the vaccine for myself or my children. We are all healthy individuals and I believe the risk of a new vaccine is greater than the risk of getting Covid-19.
33441,R3ID035833,2021-04-14T07:46:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am not yet confident that the vaccine is safe. I am not anti-vax and I vaccinate my children, but I am apprehensive about giving them a vaccine that has not yet been proven to be safe. I believe the risks of them having serious complications from Covid are lower than the risk of having an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I do not plan to receive the vaccine for myself either."
33442,R3ID035833,2021-05-12T07:12:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't believe it has been given enough time to be proven safe.
33443,R3ID035833,2021-06-10T05:29:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to get the vaccine. I believe I am healthy enough to fight the virus naturally and I would rather have natural antibodies.
33447,R3ID035833,2021-10-16T09:07:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine is mostly safe, but I do not plan to get it. I am pregnant and do not want to risk anything. I also feel that the vaccine has not been shown to be effective enough for me to get it."
33451,R3ID035834,2021-03-17T09:39:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"Feel good, will absolutely get it when I?m eligible."
33452,R3ID035834,2021-10-14T09:07:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it.  Will have my kids get it.
33453,R3ID035834,2021-11-12T09:42:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe.  Everyone in my family who can get it has gotten it, and my youngest will get it when she?s eligible."
33457,R3ID035835,2021-07-08T14:08:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe the vaccine is safe and I have gotten my vaccine.
33461,R3ID035836,2021-05-12T09:05:14Z,NA,NA,NA,It makes people sick.  The government is making us sick.
33462,R3ID035836,2021-07-09T09:19:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"We do not vaccinate, it is unsafe and pushy"
33464,R3ID035837,2021-04-15T16:49:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is safe, I have recieved my first dose"
33466,R3ID035837,2021-11-14T17:45:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Have already gotten it. It's safe and effective. Im frustrated so many wont get it
33472,R3ID035841,2021-04-14T09:18:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get the vaccine for myself and my children. My husband has decided to forego a vaccine for the time being.
33474,R3ID035841,2021-05-12T10:20:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan on getting myself and my children vaccinated
33476,R3ID035841,2021-07-07T11:42:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I will be vaccinated when I can get someone to take me. My spouse is against the vaccine and won?t agree to take me
33480,R3ID035844,2021-03-18T14:32:00Z,NA,NA,NA,We plan to get it as soon as possible. We believe the vaccine is safer than COVID.
33482,R3ID035844,2021-04-15T15:00:55Z,NA,NA,NA,All members of my family will get thr vaccine as soon as they are eligible. 3 out of 4 members are high-risk so it is safer to get thr vaccine than risk COVID.
33492,R3ID035847,2021-03-18T19:32:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m not ready to take a shot, I would prefer to wait a few more months just to see if there are any side affects for the first batch of people who took it"
33494,R3ID035847,2021-04-15T11:21:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Not feeling confident about it with all the blood clotting news that?s out in the press
33496,R3ID035847,2021-05-12T12:25:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I am really uncertain about it and I would like to give it a full year to see the affects on others before I take it
33497,R3ID035847,2021-06-09T09:35:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Honestly I?m still uncertain about it I?m not rushing to get the vaccine I want to wait a year to see if there are any major side affects outside of what we know
33499,R3ID035847,2021-07-07T12:41:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I am uncertain about it people who got the vaccine have still been diagnosed with Covid so not sure why I should rush to take a shot that hasn?t been FDA approved when I can still get Covid
33504,R3ID035847,2021-09-15T15:36:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m on the fence about it, on one hand it?s saving lives because it prevents Covid from not being as bad as it could be if you get it, but on the other hand I?m hearing it cause infertility and other side affects, but at this point it?s a necessary evil if it?s going to prevent you from dying"
33506,R3ID035847,2021-10-14T07:41:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am 50/50 about it, I do believe it is needed to prevent death and major illness from the virus but it is not the cure, Covid is still a threat and it?s not going anywhere, because of job requirements I had to take the vaccine"
33508,R3ID035847,2021-11-11T07:12:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"Still on the fence about it, I think it reduce hospitalization, I also believe it may cause the symptoms to not be as bad with the vaccine but certainly it?s not the cure, people are still getting sick, I don?t like the fact that they are making it seem like it?s a cure, it?s not, I personally know of coworkers who got the shot and still got really ill with Covid, people are just fighting to go back to some sense of normalcy but it will never be the same, we need to wear mask forever and be careful with concerts and large gatherings, I got the shot because it was mandatory"
33510,R3ID035847,2021-12-08T17:17:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"Honestly I have an issue with how Mayor Bill De Blasio (New York) is handling the vaccine mandates on the private sector, people should have a right to take it or not without the fear of losing their jobs. Also I feel like they are not telling the truth about the fact that persons are still becoming infected with Covid with or without the vaccine. I do believe it is effective in terms of when a person does get Covid the symptoms aren?t as bad but they need to be honest about that fact, stop making it seem like once you get the shot you?re  safe because reality is you can still get sick!!"
33514,R3ID035848,2021-12-08T15:35:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it's needed. I've already received the vaccine.
33516,R3ID035849,2021-04-15T14:19:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe. I received it.
33517,R3ID035849,2021-05-12T08:44:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. Would like my daughter vaccinated ASAP
33522,R3ID035850,2021-03-17T10:27:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I am currently pregnant so not planning to get it until afterward
33523,R3ID035850,2021-04-14T07:47:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I may get it once I am.no longer pregnant
33525,R3ID035850,2021-05-12T07:58:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get it later
33526,R3ID035850,2021-06-09T12:39:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it once I am no longer pregnant
33528,R3ID035850,2021-10-13T10:36:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it and I am hoping it is effective
33531,R3ID035852,2021-05-12T12:47:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have it, My husband got it, my adult daughter got it. Not sure if I want to vaccinate my 3 year old right away,"
33533,R3ID035852,2021-06-09T11:51:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as well as my husband and our 19 year old.
33535,R3ID035852,2021-09-16T10:31:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated
33536,R3ID035852,2021-12-08T12:16:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had it and the booster. I think they are safe and effective and worth getting.
33538,R3ID035853,2021-06-10T19:39:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Get it
33540,R3ID035853,2021-10-13T09:02:59Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and effective; I got it.
33543,R3ID035854,2021-06-09T08:36:05Z,NA,NA,NA,Wont be getting it
33545,R3ID035855,2021-05-12T21:18:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated, and I am happy that vaccinations are available."
33548,R3ID035855,2021-09-15T17:55:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is safe and effective. I am vaccinated, as is my spouse."
33549,R3ID035855,2021-12-08T19:29:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it is safe and effective, and have received my booster shot."
33551,R3ID035856,2021-03-19T08:45:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is safe, and since it is available to me I will get it."
33554,R3ID035858,2021-03-18T14:42:11Z,NA,NA,NA,we dony get flu or covid shots because there are different strains
33557,R3ID035858,2021-07-09T08:07:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm still not sure. i dotn get flu shots so will probably skip it
33561,R3ID035859,2021-10-13T08:12:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the Pzifer vaccine for both initial shots and the booster.
33569,R3ID035862,2021-06-09T09:09:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already and I believe in science!
33570,R3ID035862,2021-10-16T08:07:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I got mine!
33576,R3ID035868,2021-09-15T09:41:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"Since I've had covid already I decided after much research, to only get one dose of the vaccine for now. I think its mostly safe but I've heard younger people having heart issues with it. I will not allow my children to get it until there has been extensive testing and more time has passed to see long term effects."
33581,R3ID035872,2021-03-19T16:41:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it
33582,R3ID035872,2021-05-12T10:52:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont trust it.
33583,R3ID035872,2021-06-09T09:41:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Don't agree with it
33584,R3ID035872,2021-07-09T15:07:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Don't trust it
33589,R3ID035872,2021-11-10T09:46:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think its been out long enough to know much about it.
33590,R3ID035872,2021-12-14T12:48:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think its safe yet.
33592,R3ID035875,2021-07-08T07:56:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe. It is safer than getting COVID!
33599,R3ID035880,2021-04-16T14:31:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Ive recieved my first dose, im pregnant"
33603,R3ID035883,2021-04-14T21:46:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it may be safe. I do not plan on getting it as I am trying to get pregnant and we don?t know it?s long term effects and I?m not high risk
33605,R3ID035883,2021-06-09T15:30:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is effective itself but i don?t think getting it will change the politics of the shutdown. I do not plan to get it because I am not high risk.
33609,R3ID035883,2021-12-08T10:13:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s a good idea for older and immunocompromised individuals but not necessary for those at low risk. The lack of long term studies is what concerns me. I do not plan to get the vaccine at this time.
33612,R3ID035884,2021-11-10T10:40:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it, planning for my child to get it"
33613,R3ID035886,2021-05-12T18:15:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it dec 2020. Safety - felt somewhat comfortable. Effectiveness- not confident as I?m immunosuppressed and no studies in that population were done.
33615,R3ID035887,2021-04-15T17:43:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont trust it
33616,R3ID035887,2021-05-12T19:16:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure if I will get it
33617,R3ID035887,2021-07-07T10:16:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"Still worried about it, but I got it"
33622,R3ID035889,2021-06-09T09:11:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Already happily received vaccine
33623,R3ID035889,2021-07-07T09:16:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine gratefully. I trust the vaccine and know risks are minimal
33631,R3ID035892,2021-04-15T13:32:41Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s good.
33635,R3ID035893,2021-03-17T10:58:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"I want to wait for a little while, because it still makes me a little nervous"
33636,R3ID035893,2021-04-14T12:36:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not 100% excited about it
33642,R3ID035893,2021-11-10T13:42:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, but only because I needed it for travel."
33644,R3ID035900,2021-07-07T08:07:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it because my spouse wanted me to get it.  I am concerned about long term effects of it.
33649,R3ID035904,2021-04-15T15:08:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had my 1st dose due for my 2nd on the 27th. I feel safe in recieving it for me however my older son (20) will not be getting it due to kidney and other issues. I dont feel there have been enlugh studies on its effects on his meds and current health problems to assure me it would be safe for him. My 11 year old will recieve it when possible my 4 year old only with approval from her allergist..
33653,R3ID035905,2021-05-12T22:04:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Do not feel comfortable not knowing long-term affects
33656,R3ID035906,2021-03-18T22:09:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"Because of where i work and that I don't have certain health issues, I am in the next to last priority group to get the vaccine. So right now i'm not even allowed to get it.  But when I do become eligible, I'd like to get the 1-dose Johnson& Johnson version because I know it has been tested in Europe as well and even though it's percentages of effectiveness against catching Covid-19 are lower than the other two out right now, it has undergone more testing and I feel safer with it. I worry about jumping into brand new vaccines without having time to discover potential long-term side effects. So I am sort of thankful I am so low on the priority list. They can catch some of the side effects before the vaccine gets to me.   I also worry this will become like the yearly flu shot thing. I do worry about peopke becoming too reliant on yearly vaccines that their bodies don't react as they should to new viruses."
33657,R3ID035906,2021-06-10T12:18:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have doubts. I don't like the idea of putting chemicals into my body and not knowing potential long-term effects. I'm worried because we're trying to get pregnant and there are no answers about if the vaccine affects that. And lastly I don't like the idea it will be like the flu shot and probably something you'll have to get every year. I am still on the fence about getting it. On one hand I want to protect my children, but on the other I don't entirely trust the drug itself. I have a fear that I will have one of the rare serious reactions and that I'll die from the vaccine itself."
33659,R3ID035906,2021-11-12T11:55:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"It seems okay. However none of them have withstood the test of time yet. There hasn't been enough time to determine long-term side effects. And there are some VERY SCARY side effects from the vaccines that specifically affect people of my age and gender that the majority of the medical researchers seem to be glossing over. Issues related to reproductive issues is a major concern for me!  
Also, the fact that the virus mutates and evolves so quickly that the vaccines are not able to be a ""once and done deal"", concerns me. I don't want to be stuck taking boosters for the rest of my life...especially boosters that have had not had the chance to have their long term side effects researched.

Currently I do not know what I will do about the vaccination. With my luck, I would probably be one of the ones who suffered and was hospitalized because of the vaccine...while the actual virus did not have as big an effect on me."
33660,R3ID035906,2021-12-10T07:32:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't think we have had it around long enough to truly know long-term side effects. Every time I consider getting it, another side effect is discovered to be prevalent in people of my age and gender. I know there are lots of people saying it's completely safe, but people used to think cocaine was a medical miracle drug too (until through the test of time, it was discovered that was not the case). 
As for effectiveness, the more the government says people need more booster shots to hopefully not get as sick possibly from the virus, the more I feel I will not be getting the vaccine because it is inferior in what it is supposed to do. The polio vaccine is a once and done deal to prevent polio. That vaccine I trust. I trust none of the Covid-19 vaccines, as they are not effective for combating this rapidly-mutating virus without multiple boosters. If I get a vaccine I want to know it will be a one-time thing and I will be protected for the rest of my life. With how fast Covid-19 mutates and how medical scientists seem to be reacting to new variants instead of figuring how to eradicate the whole virus, I don't think there will truly be a vaccine worth trusting any time soon."

34043,R3ID036067,2021-12-11T23:24:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it loses effectiveness significantly over a short period of time
34048,R3ID036074,2021-07-07T20:58:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"Received first dose myself in December 2020. As soon as my child is eligible, we will vaccinate."

34053,R3ID036080,2021-09-17T10:21:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated.
34055,R3ID036083,2021-10-16T11:56:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure on safety, most people I know who got it have been fine but I have seen many cases of people not doing well, blood clots etc. Effectiveness wakes after a while so unless I'm willing to get multiple boosters too I don't really see the point. At this time I am not getting the covid shots"
34057,R3ID036087,2021-07-09T15:25:23Z,NA,NA,NA,its not safe
34060,R3ID036087,2021-12-08T16:44:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I have had covid so I don't have any reason to get the vaccine. I think it's good for people that haven't had covid to get the vaccine though if they are older or sick.
34063,R3ID036089,2021-04-14T18:29:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Think it?s still risky but better odds than covid
34071,R3ID036090,2021-05-13T18:37:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it due to other health issues
34074,R3ID036091,2021-10-13T09:46:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I have full faith in the vaccine and have received both doses.

34080,R3ID036095,2021-05-13T17:36:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is a good idea and I want to get it but I want to wait till further testing is done.

34085,R3ID036096,2021-03-17T09:03:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I plan to get it, but I am hesitant to get my child the vaccine right away, as I know it is still being tested on kids"
34090,R3ID036096,2021-11-10T20:40:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Confident. Already received it. Waiting on booster. Also waiting on it to become available to under-2s.
34091,R3ID036096,2021-12-08T09:30:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Good, satisfied, not concerned. Will be getting booster soon."

34109,R3ID036108,2021-06-09T10:04:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m waiting for my ob to clear me because I?m breastfeeding
34115,R3ID036111,2021-09-17T09:10:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Still reallt unsure about it

34145,R3ID036123,2021-11-15T19:54:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already gotten it and intend to get a booster when I can. The science shows how effective it in combo with social distancing is.
34150,R3ID036125,2021-04-15T14:17:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got it, but not sure what to o do about my children"
34152,R3ID036128,2021-04-16T16:30:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Absolutely completely definitely getting it for all family members ASAP

34156,R3ID036129,2021-06-10T21:11:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it was rushed but could still be effective
34157,R3ID036129,2021-07-07T22:33:38Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s still too new to know
34165,R3ID036142,2021-03-17T13:25:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting as not enough research and possible severe allergic reaction
34168,R3ID036142,2021-09-15T08:52:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I worry about it but feel the research supports getting it
34169,R3ID036142,2021-12-08T13:41:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was questioning it's safety and long term side effects, especially for nursing mothers but after a great deal of scientific reading and additional papers being released, I did get it."
34171,R3ID036145,2021-03-17T10:55:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t believe it?s been tested in order to know the long term effects and will not get the vaccine
34175,R3ID036145,2021-12-10T08:08:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I have not gotten the vaccine because it is too new and they?re have been many reports of complications.

34208,R3ID036157,2021-05-12T07:27:40Z,NA,NA,NA,We are waiting to see what happens with it in the coming year.
34209,R3ID036157,2021-07-09T10:41:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
34213,R3ID036157,2021-10-13T08:40:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't trust its safety, but was mandated to get it to keep working in healthcare. The rest of my family will not get it."
34216,R3ID036159,2021-04-14T18:02:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have had one dose and plan to get the second. I feel confident in its safety and effectiveness. At the very least, it is safer than getting the virus. I am hopeful it will protect against the variants as well."
34218,R3ID036159,2021-09-16T10:00:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel very confident in the vaccine's safety. I am fully vaccinated and intend to vaccinate my child as well.

34228,R3ID036169,2021-06-10T09:24:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am not opposed to it, but because i am not at risk, i am going to wait a little longer before getting it for myself or my children"
34230,R3ID036169,2021-10-13T12:18:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not opposed or afraid of it. I think it is a good option for those that need it. I personally feel that since i have had covid and am not in the ?at risk? age groups that it isn?t necessary for me to get it at this time
34231,R3ID036169,2021-11-10T13:27:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m not opposed to it, but don?t see a huge need since I have had it and am not at risk"
34239,R3ID036176,2021-06-10T05:22:33Z,NA,NA,NA,More long term effectiveness evidence is needed; will not be getting it until finished breastfeeding as there is insufficient evidence of its safety for mother/baby

34241,R3ID036176,2021-09-15T18:50:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not be getting it due to natural immunity from having Covid but feel improved safety of the vaccine is proven due to FDA approval

34245,R3ID036183,2021-04-15T13:57:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Im still hesistant to get the vaccine because I'm unsure of reactions to it. Especially now people are getting blood clots from the Johnson & Johnson one.

34248,R3ID036183,2021-12-14T15:23:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm afraid of the effectiveness and if it's worth even getting it. I've know people who have had issues after receiving it and then they still end up with covid. I haven't gotten yet and I'm still undecided whether i will or not.
34250,R3ID036184,2021-03-17T10:03:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I am concerned with the unknown long term effects and potential fertility effects as we may want to grow our family in the next few years
34254,R3ID036186,2021-06-09T10:57:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the shot for antibodies for my daughter through breastmilk. I?m a little sckeptical because I wish it had been studied for at least 5 years to see side effects.

34281,R3ID036199,2021-03-17T14:40:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it was rushed and safety measures may have been overlooked. I will wait to get it
34282,R3ID036199,2021-09-15T09:07:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it and I feel it is the best thing to do
34283,R3ID036199,2021-11-10T09:56:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten it, so have my two boys. I am a little worried about the safety because it was rushed, but I am more afraid of dying of COVID. My husband will not get it and the baby has not had it. I do not know if she will be getting it or not when it is available to her, I haven't made up my mind."
34284,R3ID036200,2021-10-13T19:24:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan on getting the COVID 19 vaccine

34300,R3ID036219,2021-07-07T13:40:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think there is enough research surrounding it yet. I will not be getting it
34304,R3ID036220,2021-04-14T07:08:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get the vaccine when done nursing. Without that group in part of the trial I am waiting.
34315,R3ID036221,2021-12-08T09:56:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I felt nervous but still got vaccinated due to having a high risk child
34317,R3ID036222,2021-03-19T15:07:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's still in the early stages and is pretty experimental. I don't plan to get it any time soon

34331,R3ID036231,2021-05-12T09:08:04Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have received it and feel it is safe. I would be concerned to have my children get it because they are so young and it is so new.
34332,R3ID036231,2021-07-07T08:30:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it.

34334,R3ID036231,2021-11-14T09:11:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe. I have concerns about using an emergency use vaccine for children when the virus has cause little effect to any children I know.

34350,R3ID036240,2021-09-16T12:39:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it should NOT be pushed. I feel that it should be your choice to get it or not to get it. People should not be punished for their medical choice.
34351,R3ID036241,2021-04-14T21:21:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it already. I think it is safe and we should all get it in order to end this pandemic.

However, I think it's better than nothing and I'm grateful we can get it. I personally haven't gotten the vaccine yet because I have a nursing child and there has been nearly no data of its safety until recently (which is still preliminary). Though I will probably get the vaccine as more data come out about that. I am not opposed to it."
34416,R3ID036273,2021-06-09T09:06:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I would like to see more long term data before getting the shot. But I  am enjoying personally because i have a nursing child at home. I will probably get it after that.
34417,R3ID036273,2021-09-16T20:47:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have been fully vaccinated. Though, I do fear the long-term consequences and the unknown about this vaccine."

34885,R3ID036483,2021-09-16T21:52:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it's as safe and effective as other vaccines. I'm vaccinated and will get a booster if it is recommended in the future
34886,R3ID036484,2021-04-16T05:33:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Most likely safe enough, already got first one"
34892,R3ID036486,2021-12-14T21:30:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is somewhat effective. I got the vaccine in March/ April 2021. At the time, I thought it was going to be more effective in the long term. I do not plan to get a booster shot at this time. I'm also concerned about side effects in children and will not be getting my children vaccinated."
34894,R3ID036489,2021-03-17T21:31:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's safer than the virus and our best chance at being safe and healthy.
34895,R3ID036489,2021-04-14T18:27:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. It is certainly better than getting Covid19. I just received my first shot this week.

34910,R3ID036493,2021-04-15T14:22:08Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s of questionable safety and I won?t be getting it
34911,R3ID036493,2021-05-12T17:55:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Do not trust the listed efficacy and safety. Will not be getting them.
34912,R3ID036493,2021-06-10T18:49:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it due to insufficient studies and concerns with safety/efficacy
34913,R3ID036493,2021-07-08T16:41:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe and not getting it. The likelihood of hospitalization and death with and without the vaccine is almost identical.

34957,R3ID036511,2021-05-14T12:32:54Z,NA,NA,NA,already received

34979,R3ID036519,2021-03-17T12:39:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I consider it safe enough for my spouse and I to get it. We are getting it at separate times in case we have a reaction to it. (Don't want both parents sick at the same time.) We do not plan to vaccinate our children, though, until more research has been done."
34980,R3ID036519,2021-06-09T09:26:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vaccine is safe and valuable. My husband and I both already got both doses. I'm less convinced about having my young children get it.
34982,R3ID036520,2021-04-16T10:02:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. Seems safe
34986,R3ID036522,2021-11-10T11:27:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"Excited about it, feel it?s safe and effective, my husband and I have already had both doses"

35010,R3ID036529,2021-12-12T08:51:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it's very safe. There was been billions of doses given. If it wasn't safe, we would know. 

I've been boosted, my husband is fully vaccinated without a booster yet, and my 5 year old is fully vaccinated. Just waiting for my 2 year old to be eligible."
35014,R3ID036532,2021-03-18T12:03:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Worried about future side effects

35032,R3ID036539,2021-05-13T14:30:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that its probably very safe and mostly effective. I plan to get it as soon as I'm physically ready after giving birth.
35036,R3ID036539,2021-12-08T10:57:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine is safe.

35038,R3ID036540,2021-04-14T12:41:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I intend on giving it for myself as soon as my insurer opens an appointment. My husband has his first shot already.

I do think the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others, and have received the vaccine as well as the booster."

35193,R3ID036593,2021-04-14T09:42:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is pretty good and effective. I'm not getting the shot yet because I am breastfeeding and there hasn't been much research on breastfeeding and the shot

35215,R3ID036600,2021-10-13T20:17:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Yup got it while pregnant early on. Kinda wish I got it later in the pregnancy to give her longer lasting antibodies
35219,R3ID036601,2021-05-13T15:46:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am confident the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and have already received both doses."

I have recently received my 3rd dose booster (and was trusting enough of the efficacy to receive my first dose while breastfeeding, at a time when the data was still fairly inconclusive on that front)."
35225,R3ID036604,2021-03-19T04:58:02Z,NA,NA,NA,No way will I be getting it
35227,R3ID036605,2021-03-17T09:42:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated.  Not concerned about safety.

35239,R3ID036609,2021-03-17T09:09:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my first dose.
35243,R3ID036611,2021-07-07T09:04:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe and my husband and I have been vaccinated. It still concerns me giving it to my child though
35244,R3ID036611,2021-12-10T12:05:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is both safe and effective. My 91 year old grandfather survived covid and I truly believe it was because he was vaccinated. I received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and just got a booster shot of Moderna on Wednesday.

I don't particularly WANT to get the vaccine right away but i desperately want life to have some semblance of normalcy again... so i will get it at some point but i haven't tried to rush out and sign up yet"
35256,R3ID036619,2021-10-13T11:23:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and believe it is both safe and effective in helping to reducing severe and fatal cases of COVID 19

35262,R3ID036623,2021-05-12T07:29:44Z,NA,NA,NA,OK... I waited and got 1 dose of Moderna so far. 2nd dose this weekend
35266,R3ID036624,2021-10-16T09:02:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not feel that it is safe because they are not transparent about the risks. It still feels very experimental to me, and I will not take the risk when covid itself was no worse than a bad cold for me and my husband."
35267,R3ID036624,2021-12-08T09:34:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not feel that it is safe or effective. It feels like all risk and no reward. I am not putting an experimental ?vaccine? that is proven to not work against getting covid or giving it to others. I certainly won?t let my children be guinea pigs.
35269,R3ID036627,2021-05-12T07:11:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"I recieved the Pfizer vaccine, felt it was safe and effective"

35476,R3ID036723,2021-10-14T08:31:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I am scared to make a decision because i dont trust either side as being homest or transparent.

35505,R3ID036742,2021-06-09T09:19:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Im still on wait and see mode. I keep hearing some concerning things about some vaccines.
35508,R3ID036742,2021-09-15T08:34:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Right now I am thinking about getting it. But then I see people dying from covid who are vaccinated and I wonder if it's worth the side effects.
35509,R3ID036742,2021-12-08T10:07:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm still on the fence about getting it. My family member that was in the hospital had already had covid. He also had the vaccine. So I'm a little unsure if it works.
35511,R3ID036745,2021-03-17T21:50:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already received both doses of Moderna
35517,R3ID036750,2021-04-15T13:36:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the vaccine. I feel pretty good about it.

35524,R3ID036752,2021-09-15T18:10:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I still dont feel that anyone is properly answering questions about this vaccine. I want facts and hard data not propaganda. In this country all we get is propaganda advertising and force.
35525,R3ID036752,2021-10-16T11:07:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe or effective not getting it should not be forced
35527,R3ID036752,2021-12-10T13:09:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it. I have seen bad side effects from it multiple times. I work in Healthcare. What I see with my own eyes tells me all I need to know.
35528,R3ID036755,2021-04-15T07:41:41Z,NA,NA,NA,my wife got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine through work (that's what they did for all employees) just days before states shut down it's use. Now we're concerned about reactions to it. She's had a pretty rough time with a fever over 100 for 6 days (some days it was over 103). I got a different vaccine but that vaccine makes me really nervous.
35536,R3ID036757,2021-11-12T09:05:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"Nope, hell no. I will not be getting it and my daughter certainly will not be getting it under any circumstance. I will be homeschooling her if mandatory vaccinations become necessary to attend public school."
35542,R3ID036761,2021-11-10T14:40:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not quite trust it. I don?t want to get it if I do not have to
35549,R3ID036767,2021-09-16T09:03:15Z,NA,NA,NA,The adults in the family have gotten it.
35557,R3ID036770,2021-10-13T08:19:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it shortly after it was available. I was hesitant but risks of being unvaccinated seemed to outweigh the risks of the vaccine.
35559,R3ID036771,2021-06-09T09:14:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't believe the vaccine is completely safe or effective due to the lack of research and knowledge about the vaccine but I did get it.
35562,R3ID036772,2021-03-19T19:43:03Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I both already have our first doses and we'll get our second doses at the end of March.  I feel good about it.
35563,R3ID036772,2021-07-07T19:01:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I felt safe getting one and scheduled as soon as I was eligible.
35564,R3ID036772,2021-11-13T19:47:38Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I both took it as soon as we qualified for it.  My son who is 6 just got his first shot and his second shot is scheduled in a few weeks.  I will get it for our daughter (1 year old) as soon as possible.  We believe it's the best resource for protection.
35565,R3ID036774,2021-05-12T10:10:43Z,NA,NA,NA,Plan to get it
35569,R3ID036776,2021-04-14T13:59:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am half vaccinated, will be getting my second shot in a week."

35572,R3ID036776,2021-09-15T13:49:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine as soon as I was able to do so. I am very glad to have it!
35573,R3ID036776,2021-11-10T14:44:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I myself am vaccinated and glad to have gotten the vaccine. I think there is a lot of unfortunate misinformation out about the vaccine, I am surprised how many people have not yet gotten it."
35574,R3ID036776,2021-12-10T15:48:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have both doses as well as my booster. I feel that Pfizer and Moderna are safe vaccines. I am not so confident in J&J, and I think it's side effects seem to be worse due to anecdotal stories I've heard from friends."
35577,R3ID036778,2021-04-14T11:17:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"not too sure how I feel about the safety and effectiveness of it, I don't think it has been around long enough to know the long term affects either way. I do not plan on getting it as I am pregnant and in child bearing years and don't feel like enough is known about fertility implications."
35578,R3ID036778,2021-06-10T09:30:04Z,NA,NA,NA,i will not be getting it as I am pregnant and I don't think there has been enough studies on it. Also I feel like by the time I deliver Covid will be more gone than not so I am not worried about it
35579,R3ID036778,2021-07-07T10:27:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"not going to get it, still not enough evidence in usefulness"
35581,R3ID036778,2021-12-08T10:00:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I still think we don't know what the affects of the vaccine is going to be in the coming years. I also don't like this whole continue to have to get boosters. I do not plan to get the vaccine because of the use and testing on fetal cell lines. If a vaccine was made without that and not tested on it then I would consider it.
35583,R3ID036779,2021-03-17T08:58:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure

35606,R3ID036792,2021-04-15T14:37:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are both fully vaccinated now. I think they are very effective. I'm not sure whether they are safe, but not getting vaccinated seems more dangerous right now."
35608,R3ID036792,2021-12-10T08:34:41Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I and oldest daughter are vaccinated. My 4 year old will be vaccinated when he is able.

35620,R3ID036803,2021-10-13T08:26:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it. I will not give it to my kids as there are no long term studies on side effects.
35622,R3ID036805,2021-06-09T13:55:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I currently am not planning on getting the vaccine. I've had covid and hope my antibodies will protect me or at least make symptoms less severe should I get reinfected. I have a lot of worries and questions about the long term safety and efficacy of the vaccine. I've known several people who have still been diagnosed with covid after both injections.
35627,R3ID036805,2021-11-10T12:51:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I currently do not feel comfortable receiving it so I am holding off. I have had covid and I feel natural immunity is superior than vaccine related immunity to this particular type of virus. I also have extensive surgeries and health issues and since then, my body reacts differently to many things and medications that it did not before.

It seems like the research shows it is effective at preventing spread as well as lessening severity of symptoms if those who have had the vaccine end up getting COVID-19.
35732,R3ID036872,2021-04-14T09:10:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I am undecided right now. I feel like there may not be enough information about possible long term effects.

35758,R3ID036884,2021-09-15T08:09:22Z,NA,NA,NA,My feelings have changed over the past few months in a more favorable way as I have seen more people I know get the vaccine. I originally was not planning to get it but now I'm planning to get it if for nothing else but to protect my 2 children who are both under 12 years of age.
35759,R3ID036884,2021-10-14T08:23:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was totally against it in the beginning and had a ""wait and see"" position about it. Since it has began spiking again especially since the Delta variant I have decided to get it. I'll be getting it next week at my regular doctor's appointment."

35777,R3ID036887,2021-09-16T20:52:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it is safe, and as a cancer survivor, I chose to get the vaccine earlier this year to give my body extra support should I encounter the virus."

35800,R3ID036898,2021-11-13T11:38:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"The adults are fully vaccinated. My children are not getting vaccinated. As my 8 year old says, she has done her part(wearing masks, social distance, not traveling etc) and has gotten her flu shot, why does she need to get a vaccine when adults are doing their part?"

35981,R3ID037099,2021-03-17T13:13:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Going to get it
35985,R3ID037099,2021-10-14T12:10:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it
35988,R3ID037101,2021-10-16T08:37:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe

35990,R3ID037103,2021-07-09T08:36:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I am a teacher so I plan to get it after my pregnancy.
35991,R3ID037103,2021-09-15T13:38:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get it as soon as I deliver baby number 2.
35996,R3ID037109,2021-03-18T21:27:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident about the vaccine. My partner got it this week and I will have it tomorrow. I am not ready to get my children vaccinated with it until their are more studies done.
36000,R3ID037112,2021-06-09T08:12:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the mRNA vaccines are safe enough  and the likelihood of longterm serious adverse reactions to it are low compared to the risk of contracting the disease without it. My husband and I have already received both doses. I would like to see what kinds of reactions are revealed for children 6 and under once the vaccine is being widely distributed in that age group before giving it to my young children, since the likelihood of severe illness is very low in children and mask wearing is very effective."
36002,R3ID037112,2021-11-10T09:31:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten the covid-19 vaccine in order to reduce the spread to vulnerable individuals. It has been shown to be effective. It has shown to be reasonably safe in the short term and likely reasonable safe from severe side effects in the long run, although I am concerned about potential long-term less severe side effects. For instance, a month or two after receiving the vaccine I started breaking out in rashes periodically and seemingly randomly and have not been able to determine the cause."
36009,R3ID037117,2021-03-17T10:55:30Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I plan to get the vaccine as soon as we are eligible. (I haven't heard much in terms of its availability for children yet.)
36011,R3ID037117,2021-11-12T05:12:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe and effective. My husband and I are vaccinated and our two older kids (ages 8 and 9) will be getting their first dose this weekend.
36012,R3ID037117,2021-12-14T12:48:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received both original doses of the Moderna vaccine over six months ago and am scheduled for my booster this Friday. I wish it were 100% effective, but don't we all. I believe it is safe and worth it, possibly even the reason I didn't end up in the hospital or worse."
36014,R3ID037119,2021-05-12T10:56:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine, I think its safe"
36020,R3ID037136,2021-10-13T10:14:59Z,NA,NA,NA,i have been vaccinated and as soon as it is available my daughter will get it. I trust it because I Have a functioning brain
36022,R3ID037138,2021-06-09T09:52:04Z,NA,NA,NA,Probably won't get it till there is better data out there.
36024,R3ID037138,2021-07-08T14:30:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Deciding not to get them till there is more data out there for it.

36031,R3ID037138,2021-11-13T22:27:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Probably not going to get it.
36032,R3ID037138,2021-12-08T10:40:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"Probably won't get it till there is more data out there. If the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting Covid, it shouldn't be called a vaccine, but more like a flu shot. People die from the flu every year and no one bats a eye to it, but COVID becomes a popular virus."
36035,R3ID037140,2021-04-15T13:45:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m pregnant now but want to wait until after to get it.
36043,R3ID037147,2021-03-18T15:25:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not really sure about it so I don?t really know how to respond
36045,R3ID037147,2021-12-10T20:00:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not really sure how I feel about it there's things that I understand about it

36063,R3ID037155,2021-11-10T11:45:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I fully support the vaccine as a healthcare professional. I have received all vaccines including booster and will vaccinate my child ASAP when a vaccine is released for his age group. The risk of getting severe COVID is much higher than the rare and temporary side effects of the vaccination. Even mild to moderate COVID can leave lasting side effects including loss of taste and smell, white matter changes in the brain and decreased lung compliance that I am not willing to risk."
36065,R3ID037155,2021-12-14T18:19:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Fully support. I am fully vaccinated with booster and look forward to vaccinating my 2yo when available

36075,R3ID037177,2021-09-15T23:29:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Im worried about the long term effects even some short term but i already received it
36076,R3ID037177,2021-10-13T08:08:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I have mixed emotions about the vaccine.  But i was still vaccinated.
36077,R3ID037177,2021-12-09T21:02:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm really unsure about it's effectiveness.  I was vaccinated and I really do believe if I wasn't after contracting covid, that I wouldve been hospitalized or worse. As far as the long term effects I am worried what could happen"
36083,R3ID037184,2021-03-17T10:11:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel mostly confident in Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Not sure about Johnson & Johnson. Plans to get it are when it's available to our age group
36085,R3ID037184,2021-07-08T08:46:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Better safe than sorry. Not 100% convinced it's good for our bodies in terms or side effects, but we can't afford to wait and see."

36098,R3ID037203,2021-03-17T09:08:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not getting it. I would like for it to be around for longer to see if it has side effects.
36099,R3ID037203,2021-04-14T07:32:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not planning on getting the shot until it?s been around awhile longer. I do not feel safe since we do not know the long term effects.
36100,R3ID037203,2021-05-12T07:21:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not getting it until it?s been out for awhile. I need to see long term effects.
36103,R3ID037209,2021-03-18T22:16:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I am still.doingnresearch on all of the available options. I do plan to receive it.
36105,R3ID037209,2021-04-16T11:16:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is was developed rather quickly (even the flu vaccine took 4 years to make & that was considered fast). But I understand that the mRNA vaccine had already been created and was waiting for the right virus to come along to test its efficacy. I know many who have had each of the available vaccines and i will likely get the vaccine within the next 6 months.
36106,R3ID037209,2021-05-13T20:40:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it has come a long way. I was more wary at first, but after reading up on the multiple vaccines and research i am more comfortable with some of the vaccines. I am most likely getting the vaccine as long as I can receive the vaccine from the manufacturer that I am most comfortable with."
36109,R3ID037209,2021-11-12T14:28:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I am already vaccinated.

36111,R3ID037212,2021-03-17T12:14:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Did not get the vaccine as I was pregnant almost 34wks due to uncertainty safety.
36115,R3ID037213,2021-06-10T09:51:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it.
36120,R3ID037228,2021-04-15T23:16:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I wasn?t going to get it at first because of how new it is but in the end I decided to be a good citizen and just get it done. I also work in healthcare and want to lower the risk of exposure for my parents and my children
36121,R3ID037228,2021-05-12T08:31:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it but I think it?s too new to know how safe and effective it will be.
36125,R3ID037231,2021-06-10T09:17:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not getting it.. not enough research on side effects
36128,R3ID037237,2021-04-15T16:14:43Z,NA,NA,NA,We've both gotten the vaccine
36131,R3ID037238,2021-06-10T08:42:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"There's some amount of risk because it's so new, there's no knowing the long term effects. But it's a world wide emergency, so we all have to do our part. Spouse and I fully vaccinated."

36135,R3ID037238,2021-11-10T09:12:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"At the very least, it will provide some immunity, and lessen the severity of Covid. Fully vaccinated friend got Covid, but thankfully, symptoms were mild compared to others we know of. Spouse and I are fully vaccinated. Child will get hers when she turns 5, unless they decree that 5 and under can get it before she turns 5."
36136,R3ID037238,2021-12-08T08:19:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already fully vaccinated. Will be getting booster soon. I'm pretty sure it does offer some degree of immunity. No one can be sure of the long term side effects, but at this point and with the scale of this pandemic, we are all in the same boat."
36138,R3ID037242,2021-06-10T19:52:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure yet
36139,R3ID037243,2021-03-17T09:50:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it?s safe and I will not be getting it
36140,R3ID037243,2021-04-14T11:59:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s too early to determine it?s safety and effectiveness.
36142,R3ID037243,2021-09-15T11:44:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s too new to have enough research to understand the risks and how effective it is
36143,R3ID037243,2021-10-13T09:34:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t believe it is safe enough to be giving to people it?s too new
36144,R3ID037243,2021-11-10T10:26:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it?s safe and it?s not effective
36148,R3ID037245,2021-05-12T10:56:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don?t believe it?s effective, I am leery of it, all red flags with Big Pharma as well as the government."
36150,R3ID037245,2021-06-09T14:28:38Z,NA,NA,NA,"Not safe, not getting vaccinated"

36158,R3ID037245,2021-11-10T09:09:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"The vaccine  is not safe, and it does not protect you from Covid. Persons who have received the vaccine are dying without the proper diagnosis of death so we are out here believing this vaccine is helping. They are lying to us and we have been stupid up until now."
36161,R3ID037246,2021-03-17T20:28:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel very safe and my family has received both doses

As for its effectiveness, it seems to be helping reduce a persons need to be hospitalized so it seems like it?s doing a good job. It?s still pretty new but seems to be safe for most."

36345,R3ID037370,2021-03-17T19:01:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m trying to get it through my job. I believe in science.
36346,R3ID037370,2021-04-15T17:33:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to get it. I trust science.
36353,R3ID037376,2021-03-18T15:34:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Good and I plan on getting the vaccine

36369,R3ID037376,2021-11-15T18:06:52Z,NA,NA,NA,i think it?s effective and I have gotten it.
36372,R3ID037377,2021-04-14T10:13:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine because I do want society to get back to normal.
36374,R3ID037377,2021-09-16T17:43:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine but not sure I would take a booster shot
36376,R3ID037377,2021-12-14T15:35:30Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I both received the Covid vaccine and will get my son (currently 1) the vaccine when it is available for his age. I do worry a little bit about the long term effects but I think the risk of Covid is greater.
36380,R3ID037379,2021-05-12T07:24:37Z,NA,NA,NA,It is experimental and very dangerous. We need more time and studies
36381,R3ID037381,2021-03-19T13:38:04Z,NA,NA,NA,None safe
36384,R3ID037382,2021-04-15T13:41:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I have my first shot and feel good about it.  I hope that most people will get it.  I believe it?s safe and it?s a lot more effective than not getting it.  I understand that it?s best efficacy will come from as many people getting it as possible.
36385,R3ID037382,2021-09-15T08:32:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel like it?s our best bet out of this pandemic. I drove to another city a couple hours away to get a waste dose back in the spring, and as soon as the vaccine is authorized for children under five, my son will be getting it."
36392,R3ID037391,2021-12-08T10:26:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it needs more research.
36396,R3ID037394,2021-07-09T08:11:47Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s fine but we have bad reactions to other vaccines so we won?t be getting this one
36401,R3ID037398,2021-03-19T14:39:05Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure still
36406,R3ID037398,2021-12-13T19:16:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I will be getting it
36411,R3ID037403,2021-04-14T22:02:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I am slightly anxious but believe in getting the vaccine.  I have had one dose and am scheduled to receive my second in 1.5 weeks.
36412,R3ID037403,2021-06-10T08:11:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already been vaccinated.  I feel it is safe and the right thing to do.
36413,R3ID037403,2021-07-09T13:15:08Z,NA,NA,NA,Have already gotten it.  I feel that it is safe.
36419,R3ID037406,2021-06-10T19:44:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received both Pfizer vaccinations
36421,R3ID037406,2021-10-13T20:30:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received both Pfizer doses and am eager to get my booster
36422,R3ID037406,2021-11-10T20:05:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received two doses and am eager to receive my booster.  My daughter is too young to be eligible.
36429,R3ID037410,2021-06-09T09:08:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got the shots, but unsure how safe it is for my nursing baby"
36432,R3ID037410,2021-09-15T12:43:17Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it - wondering if it would be safe to get a booster while pregnant
36434,R3ID037410,2021-12-14T17:06:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got it, not sure how effective it is"
36439,R3ID037412,2021-11-10T09:57:23Z,NA,NA,NA,A vaccines a vaccine they're genuinely good I'll get it but I want some time for the side effects
36441,R3ID037412,2021-12-08T13:54:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe and effective I may get it
36444,R3ID037415,2021-03-19T12:22:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe to get.
36446,R3ID037415,2021-04-14T09:05:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s much safer than getting COVID. My husband and I are fully vaccinated at this time.
36450,R3ID037415,2021-11-10T19:25:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I was fully vaccinated as soon as I was eligible.  It was a relief because I felt I could fully go back to work (working with disabled children who typically cannot mask well) without worrying about dying. Even if I contract Covid-19 with a vaccine severe outcomes are highly unlikely.  I do plan to get the booster as well within the next month.
36452,R3ID037417,2021-06-11T12:32:31Z,NA,NA,NA,We are not getting it testing was too rushed
36456,R3ID037421,2021-03-18T12:09:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I want to get it ASAP
36458,R3ID037421,2021-06-09T10:01:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it and looking forward to when the kids can
36461,R3ID037421,2021-12-08T09:34:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I am currently vax. Will be getting booster soon and as soon as my kids can they will be too
36465,R3ID037425,2021-04-15T13:19:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Not great - I will not be getting it. I?m sure natural immunity will be longer lasting than vaccine immunity just like nearly all of the illnesses we vaccinate against.
36466,R3ID037425,2021-05-14T12:21:15Z,NA,NA,NA,My family will not get receiving the vaccine
36470,R3ID037425,2021-11-10T09:06:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not feel it is effective enough in PREVENTING the illness, only at reducing hospitalizations - I would like a vaccine that prevents me from getting sick in the first place. I am also hesitant because I will not continue to receive additional booster shots every few months. We need a more effective vaccine that offers long lasting protection without constant boosters. I do not plan to get the vaccine at this time as I still have antibodies from natural infection and am not ?high-risk?"
36472,R3ID037428,2021-10-17T11:44:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I would rather not get the vaccine
36473,R3ID037431,2021-05-12T14:28:31Z,NA,NA,NA,No one in my family will be getting it
36475,R3ID037431,2021-09-15T17:12:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it
36480,R3ID037436,2021-04-14T07:46:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received my first Pfeizer shot, the birth control pills I take are higher risk than the J&J shot"
36483,R3ID037437,2021-06-09T09:21:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I signed up for the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, in March. I have been fully vaccinated since April."
36486,R3ID037437,2021-10-14T09:20:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received both doses as soon as I was eligible, when I was 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. I had Covid while I was pregnant and knew it was the right thing to do."
36487,R3ID037437,2021-12-08T19:20:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the vaccine while I was 22 and 26 weeks pregnant, as soon as it was available to me. I believe the vaccines are safe and effective. My baby and I (and my other children) are healthy."
36491,R3ID037442,2021-03-17T16:45:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s pretty safe
36498,R3ID037445,2021-06-09T09:34:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is effective, however a part of me is still uncertain of long term effects. I am currently pregnant and will wait to get the vaccine until after I give birth"
36509,R3ID037453,2021-07-07T09:24:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not getting it.   It?s too new and I am hesitant about the long term effects.
36510,R3ID037453,2021-09-15T20:58:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am not planning to get it.   I do not feel comfortable with how fast it came out and how it is being forced on people.  My body, my choice and I choose to not get it."
36512,R3ID037453,2021-11-10T17:22:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it should be MY choice as to whether or not I want to get vaccinated and is should NOT be mandated.   I personally don?t know that it is really that effective (I know people that had the vaccine and still got covid).   Also, because it?s so new I?m not sold on its safety or LONG term effects. 

I don?t want to get it but I?m afraid I will be FORCED to or lose my job (and we need my job because my job provides our families health benefits)"
36519,R3ID037461,2021-04-15T21:53:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Not planning to as of now due to lack of research & new side effects
36529,R3ID037464,2021-04-15T22:09:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get it

36542,R3ID037471,2021-10-13T08:24:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel safe about it.
36544,R3ID037471,2021-12-08T10:53:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it but my husband would not and our daughter is 4 yro so she cannot get it and we are waiting to give it to our son that is 6 yro.
36545,R3ID037472,2021-03-17T08:49:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received my first shot

36555,R3ID037474,2021-11-10T13:09:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and believe it?s safe. I do not plan for my five year old to get it. I feel like children are not affected by covid as much as adults.
36556,R3ID037475,2021-09-15T18:54:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"Does not prevent infection or transmission, so it's not worth the risks for those of us who already had covid"
36557,R3ID037475,2021-12-10T23:22:54Z,NA,NA,NA,They've already unblinded and vaccinated the control group--there is no long term safety comparison. My family has durable natural immunity and no plans to participate is this experiment.
36561,R3ID037477,2021-06-10T14:18:15Z,NA,NA,NA,It is too risky for me being pregnant. There is not enough long term data. I do not plan to get it until long term data is made available.
36562,R3ID037477,2021-07-08T21:03:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust it given that it is experimental in
36564,R3ID037477,2021-12-12T20:45:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Hesitant because of lack of expanded testing
36565,R3ID037478,2021-03-17T08:45:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I am leery of it because of lack of trials and lack of the honesty surrounding it. We are told it's totally safe and has no risks but I knoe people personally who have had reactions. That tells me they are not treating it fairly or scientifically.
36567,R3ID037480,2021-03-17T09:42:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get it.
36569,R3ID037483,2021-03-18T11:19:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Great! Already have both doses.

36589,R3ID037490,2021-05-12T10:07:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about it. My husband and I have both received the vaccine.
36600,R3ID037491,2021-09-15T09:33:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I understand science to a degree that allows me to trust in vaccine effacacy
36601,R3ID037491,2021-10-13T08:43:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I understand it, I trust it, I got it, my kid will too if they approve the 6mos and up version"
36602,R3ID037491,2021-12-08T10:14:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have been following the blog of an epidemiologist who is great at addressing conspiracies and objections to vaccines with facts, graphs, and empathy (Dr. Emily Smith- she's wondeful!) Doing this has helped me trust the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines and advocate them for my friends and family. I just got my booster shot!"
36608,R3ID037495,2021-09-16T14:29:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Safer than COVID. I trust science.

36655,R3ID037523,2021-11-10T19:27:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received the vaccine. I worry that it?s not effective long term due to the increasing break through infections occurring
36656,R3ID037523,2021-12-08T12:24:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe but it doesn?t seem very effective. I have received 3 doses already.

36829,R3ID037615,2021-06-10T13:50:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm concerned it hasn't been well researched due to numerous side effects and with JJ recalling some doses. I will be open to the shot when more time has passed and more data is available

36837,R3ID037615,2021-11-12T18:32:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm not convinced that it has been well researched and tested due to many of the side effects disproportionately affecting women. However, I have to get vaccinated to keep my job"

36890,R3ID037637,2021-04-16T15:54:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"The vaccines are administered to the public under EUA status, and the companies still conducting research. I don't plan to get it until the research is completed"
36894,R3ID037637,2021-07-09T14:23:01Z,NA,NA,NA,safety is age-depended. effectiveness is time-depended. maybe I'll take it in the fall after it is authorized (not EUA)
36899,R3ID037637,2021-09-17T12:08:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"the vaccine is effective as the flu vaccine (when using same test to evaluate effectiveness). however it is less safe. mandating medical procedures is a crime. MY BODY, MY CHOICE"
36901,R3ID037637,2021-10-14T11:04:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"The method of calculating effectiveness is misseading (comparing to a non-vaccinated group). in terms of what is the probabilty of getting COVID if I got the vaccine - the numbers are not so great (about 70% chances of getting COVID if exposed, for a vaccinated person). Regarding safety - 1 in 10,000 heart problem is not that safe in my opinion, especially not for a vaccine"
36905,R3ID037639,2021-04-14T08:10:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it

36914,R3ID037642,2021-04-14T08:23:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure of it, need more research done"
36924,R3ID037650,2021-05-12T09:27:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I have no concerns about the vaccine and I am so thankful that it is available.  I had my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last week.

My husband has already received his booster as he was eligible when it was authorized and I will be receiving my booster shot next week as I become eligible (as will our 6 yr old be receiving his first dose of the pediatric vaccine).
36927,R3ID037650,2021-12-14T12:35:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Our family believes very strongly in the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines, especially the mRNA versions.  My husband and I have both received our 2 dose regimen and recently have received our boosters (Moderna).  Our 6 year-old has just received his 2nd dose of the pediatric Pfizer vaccine.  I have also been nursing our 2 year old throughout the pandemic (both through having COVID and through all of my vaccine doses)."
36930,R3ID037652,2021-04-15T19:32:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't want it. It does not seem worth it, as people that have been vaccinated are having blood clots and still getting Covid."
36931,R3ID037652,2021-10-16T12:04:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Don?t trust it and don?t want it.
36936,R3ID037653,2021-10-16T09:20:54Z,NA,NA,NA,Im skeptical about the safety and effectiveness of it however I did receive it
36943,R3ID037656,2021-11-11T05:17:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I am concerned with the safety of the vaccine especially for my children. It seems this vaccine was rolled out as fast as possible and I would like to see more data on it.

36970,R3ID037668,2021-12-09T22:07:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust what doctors and scientist have to say about the vaccine. I have received the vaccine and my booster. My partner has received the vaccine and the booster. Our children have received the vaccine as have most of our immediate family members.
36971,R3ID037669,2021-07-08T13:04:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Good. Plan to have my entire family fully vaccinated as they become eligible

36980,R3ID037674,2021-04-16T13:21:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I got vaccinated with Moderna.  The medical community owes reparations to the Black community.
36983,R3ID037681,2021-04-14T08:42:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not convinced that there is enough evidence to prove whether or not it is safe. We will not be getting there s vaccine until the body of evidence is solid.
36984,R3ID037681,2021-07-07T10:37:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"I will likely be required to get it to remain employees, but am not comfortable with it. My children will not be getting the covid vaccine for the next few years until long term studies are complete"

36999,R3ID037690,2021-05-13T19:44:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received both doses. I'm still leery about its long term-effects on children or on fertility. I am done having children and felt the benefits outweighed any possible side effects for my personal situation

37054,R3ID037709,2021-11-11T11:46:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Got the vaccine and will probably get the booster.  Some of my kids are eligible for the younger vaccine now and we'll probably get them vaccinated within a few weeks

37074,R3ID037717,2021-09-15T23:43:34Z,NA,NA,NA,It is unsafe and doesn't support the original claims
37075,R3ID037717,2021-10-13T11:08:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Not safe. It triggers autoimmune illness amongst other things and thats not safe for me
37076,R3ID037717,2021-11-10T09:55:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"With my medical history, it would create more problems than it would solve and it would be safer to get covid than the vaccine. The vaccine doesn't do all that was promised either and is not as effective or safe as we are lead to believe"
37077,R3ID037717,2021-12-10T09:13:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't feel like it is safe or effective and has our created more health problems
37078,R3ID037718,2021-04-14T17:36:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m unsure. I feel I don?t have enough information to trust it. My plan is to wait a bit to see some more data on outcomes before getting it myself.
37087,R3ID037719,2021-07-07T09:26:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m going to wait for some more studies before we decide if we?re going to get it or not
37090,R3ID037719,2021-09-15T10:53:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very unsure, also don?t see the need when you can still get Covid, most likely won?t get it"
37091,R3ID037719,2021-10-13T09:16:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it. We have already had Covid (diagnosed with a positive test result) so we have natural anitbodies
37092,R3ID037719,2021-11-13T07:44:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Definitely questioning the safety and effectiveness. As of now we are not getting it since we have had the actual virus
37097,R3ID037724,2021-04-14T09:31:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"Studies show that the vaccine is very effective, I don't see any reason to doubt that. From what I've seen testing and development was rushed but took the usual steps and was based in preexisting research, so I think it's safe."
37100,R3ID037724,2021-11-10T10:55:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine once it was available to me and just this month got a booster. Corporations are flawed and not always trustworthy but the methodology behind the vaccines themselves have been transparent and follow safety procedures. My daughter is too young for the vaccine and my husband and I got it to protect her as well as ourselves.
37106,R3ID037734,2021-03-17T14:19:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it already
37110,R3ID037735,2021-06-09T11:37:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Getting my second dose today
37120,R3ID037736,2021-03-17T09:41:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm not sure how a covid vaccine was developed so quickly, but a vaccine/cure for cancer, hiv/aids hasn't been developed. Im very skeptical about it. I can get the vaccine stsrting April 5, but im not sure if i will get it."
37122,R3ID037736,2021-04-14T08:50:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"Im concerned about the long term side effects and how effective it truly is considering it was developed very quickly. I do plan on eventually getting it, not sure when."
37124,R3ID037736,2021-05-12T07:37:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I received my first dose of the vaccine 2 weeks ago.
37133,R3ID037736,2021-09-15T08:48:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my 2 doses of the vaccine.
37136,R3ID037739,2021-03-17T11:03:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve had it.
37140,R3ID037744,2021-07-07T12:32:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I have minimal concerns and i received it as soon as it was available to me
37162,R3ID037771,2021-09-15T10:20:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it due to my risk factors and pregnancy, but am concerned about long term side effects."
37163,R3ID037771,2021-11-10T11:08:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it due to risk factors, and do not doubt it's efficacy in providing better outcomes if you do contract COVID, but I do not trust that anyone knows its full safety level, based on the limited amount of time it has been in existence."
37169,R3ID037775,2021-05-14T11:51:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe & effective
37199,R3ID037798,2021-03-19T13:26:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it due to an autoimmune disease.
37201,R3ID037798,2021-05-13T17:48:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get it due to pre-existing conditions.
37203,R3ID037798,2021-07-07T13:36:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I have an autoimmune disease and I?m scared.
37206,R3ID037798,2021-09-15T08:22:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was uncertain at first, but glad that I got it."
37210,R3ID037800,2021-05-13T14:46:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m skeptical but still willing to get it
37211,R3ID037800,2021-10-13T08:24:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m still unsure about it, I am fully vaccinated though."
37212,R3ID037800,2021-11-12T09:10:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I still don't know how I feel about it, but I still got it"
37214,R3ID037801,2021-07-07T09:33:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and am waiting for the children to be able to vaccinate for my kids
37222,R3ID037805,2021-03-18T18:20:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
37227,R3ID037807,2021-12-09T10:05:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated but I'm still scared. My cousin who pass of Covid was fully vaccinated as well. I feel I am doing the best I can to keep myself, my children and everyone around me safe, but still live in fear."
37236,R3ID037811,2021-06-09T09:25:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"my husband and I both got Pfizer, we both believe it's safe but wonder when boosters will be availalble"
37247,R3ID037818,2021-09-15T10:45:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
37258,R3ID037828,2021-03-17T09:22:17Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe enough for me and my family! We will get it as soon as it is available to us.
37259,R3ID037828,2021-11-10T15:50:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated. It helps me feel safe to return to work part time. My children are too young to receive the vaccine.
37272,R3ID037834,2021-10-16T10:54:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe. The technology has been around for a couple of decades. My spouse and I are vaccinated.
37278,R3ID037836,2021-07-07T08:25:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I had it. I believe in science.
37282,R3ID037838,2021-10-13T08:43:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the first dose recently after two friends de lost close family members
37283,R3ID037838,2021-12-12T11:46:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. So I?m comfortable with the above
37290,R3ID037843,2021-04-14T23:47:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m scared of the effects it could have on society twenty years from now.
37293,R3ID037844,2021-03-17T12:03:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
37294,R3ID037844,2021-05-13T11:28:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
37297,R3ID037845,2021-03-19T14:42:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not trust the safety of vaccines and will not be getting one.
37298,R3ID037845,2021-04-15T14:18:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Don?t trust it
37300,R3ID037845,2021-07-08T08:21:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Not convinced that it?s needed for my life
37303,R3ID037845,2021-10-13T08:32:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it?s a rushed treatment and not totally necessary. About 80% of cases that I?ve known are from those that are vaccinated.
37305,R3ID037845,2021-11-12T09:06:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel like it's all experimental. The ways in which someone was able to contract Covid has changed since the beginning. The vaccine has not been tested long enough to say that the good outweighs the bad, in my opinion. Most of the people I know that contracted Covid after the vaccine was introduced, were vaccinated. I don't trust it. I don't trust big pharma at all. If my job mandates, then I will find a work from home job."
37321,R3ID037855,2021-03-17T12:48:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"We will get it, despite feeling unsure if enough long term testing has been done"
37323,R3ID037855,2021-04-16T15:46:12Z,NA,NA,NA,"Got the first vac, waiting for my second"
37326,R3ID037856,2021-03-18T12:05:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it
37327,R3ID037856,2021-06-09T13:09:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
37339,R3ID037866,2021-04-15T14:10:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I was leery but was required to get it for my workplace
37341,R3ID037866,2021-09-16T08:53:11Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure.
37349,R3ID037872,2021-10-16T15:11:02Z,NA,NA,NA,Will fully vaccinate family.
37357,R3ID037873,2021-11-10T15:28:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received it and when it is available for children under 5, my daughter will most likely get it."
37377,R3ID037890,2021-03-19T10:47:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I have Received both of mine! And my spouse has had her first
37387,R3ID037894,2021-03-17T09:02:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"In my opinion, it's still in trial. I won't be getting it. I don't get flu shots either."
37389,R3ID037894,2021-04-14T14:07:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not believe it's ready for mass distribution, and i will not get it during the early trials"
37393,R3ID037895,2021-10-13T08:48:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I will not get the vaccines.
37399,R3ID037898,2021-10-15T07:41:23Z,NA,NA,NA,Just got it after accepting research
37406,R3ID037902,2021-12-08T14:08:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and my older children are scheduled to be vaccinated. Can't wait for my younger children to be eligible (1 yr and 2 yrs old)
37412,R3ID037903,2021-05-13T17:37:09Z,NA,NA,NA,not sure about it
37416,R3ID037904,2021-03-18T12:31:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was planning on getting it and was able to because of my work, but then I actually got covid. Not that I am well, I will schedule the appointment. I think it is safe and effective."
37418,R3ID037904,2021-05-13T21:29:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I am comfortable with the vaccine for adults and feel it is effective. I was Leary at first but am now comfortable with it
37420,R3ID037904,2021-10-15T06:46:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and affective. I have gotten mine.
37424,R3ID037906,2021-09-15T17:00:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and it is effective in providing a layer of protection against COVID-19. I have received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and will receive a booster if that is indicated.
37425,R3ID037906,2021-11-10T15:07:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel like the vaccine is safe and effective, at least it gives us a line of defense, instead of having absolutely nothing. I personally am fully vaccinated, have received 2 doses of the vaccine."
37427,R3ID037907,2021-03-17T16:54:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Plan to get vaccinated
37428,R3ID037907,2021-04-14T12:38:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"Me and my husband got first shot already. I think it could be better tested with time, but I rather take it for piece of mind than don't"
37440,R3ID037913,2021-09-16T08:32:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got vaccinated
37448,R3ID037915,2021-12-08T11:46:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I will not receive the vaccine. Only ignorant people would implicitly trust a company who says they will not release full safety information for have a century while the government attempts to require people to take it. I do not believe in any vaccine that is tainted by the abortion industry in ANY phase, including testing and development. I also do not believe in modifying my immune system with a shot that does not prevent spread and contraction of the illness despite some people have up to 3 doses at this point."
37453,R3ID037918,2021-07-07T13:20:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the shot so I can protect my family
37456,R3ID037919,2021-03-19T13:23:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel unsure about both the safety and effectiveness, but I am taking the vaccine due to having to return to work in person soon, and gambling that my I will have a more favorable outcome getting the vaccine then not."
37458,R3ID037919,2021-05-12T07:40:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that more data is needed to determine its safety; however, I am vaccinated due to the nature of my job."

37474,R3ID037924,2021-07-07T08:58:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated
37479,R3ID037924,2021-10-13T10:26:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have it
37481,R3ID037924,2021-11-10T09:07:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I have the covid vaccine.  I am not planning on getting it for my 2 year old as soon as it is available for her.  I am worried about giving her such a new vaccine at such a young age.
37482,R3ID037924,2021-12-08T09:28:36Z,NA,NA,NA,i have been vaccinated

37528,R3ID037939,2021-03-17T19:28:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the first shot. I feel good about it.
37530,R3ID037939,2021-06-09T19:20:22Z,NA,NA,NA,Great. I got it
37532,R3ID037939,2021-11-10T11:05:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe and effective and everyone should get it. I have had my two shots and my booster shot.
37535,R3ID037940,2021-06-09T11:58:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont trust it and won't get it
37539,R3ID037940,2021-11-12T19:55:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it is great that there is a vaccine available that helps reduce severity of the disease, but I am strongly opposed to coercion of medical decisions and am strongly opposed to any mandates or forcing people to get the vaccine.  The more the government forces people to get vaccinated the more I question the safety and effectiveness"
37541,R3ID037940,2021-12-08T09:34:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is a wonderful option but I prefer to not get it.  I struggle with trusting a company that has been sued over past known issues but who has immunity to lawsuits for vaccines. I also know people who have had issues after getting getting their shot but it isn't even being considered as a side effect
37545,R3ID037942,2021-06-09T10:11:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure
37556,R3ID037948,2021-12-14T12:39:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel as though there is more testing that needs to be done, but that it is our best chance of getting through COVID. I think it prevents people from dying. I have my first two shots."
37559,R3ID037949,2021-09-17T09:12:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it
37564,R3ID037955,2021-03-17T09:21:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I plan on getting it, even though it did come out quickly"
37566,R3ID037955,2021-06-11T05:07:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s safe for adults and I have gotten it
37573,R3ID037957,2021-06-09T10:23:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont trust in kids yet
37575,R3ID037957,2021-07-07T10:23:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"Okay for adults, not children"
37583,R3ID037959,2021-04-14T13:06:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont trust it because there hasnt been studies long enough to see side effects. They dont know how long the protection will last if someone gets the vaccine. Me and my family won't be getting the vaccine. We had covid and it wasnt bad for any of us.
37584,R3ID037959,2021-05-12T11:14:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont think there is enough long term data to make sure it's safe. We already had covid and we are fine so no we won't get the vaccine
37588,R3ID037960,2021-04-15T16:46:14Z,NA,NA,NA,"Our household already had covid so we won't be getting the vaccine this season, unsure of long-term effects"
37590,R3ID037961,2021-10-13T08:04:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received my vaccine, but I have hesitations about my children."
37593,R3ID037965,2021-04-14T08:29:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safe (or at least safe enough) for adults and I am already vaccinated
37596,R3ID037965,2021-09-15T08:31:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it and hope it is safe
37597,R3ID037965,2021-11-10T10:12:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I already got it, but worry it won't stay effective and worry it may not be safe"
37598,R3ID037965,2021-12-10T09:36:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I am unsure if it was the right choice and pray it is safe longterm.
37600,R3ID037966,2021-10-14T00:17:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
37606,R3ID037967,2021-10-18T10:07:15Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaccinated adults in house
37607,R3ID037967,2021-12-14T13:16:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Whole household is already vaccinated.  It is as safe and effective as most vaccines
37610,R3ID037968,2021-03-18T17:08:26Z,NA,NA,NA,We'll get it as soon as it's available for our category
37611,R3ID037968,2021-06-10T13:42:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Will get it soon
37613,R3ID037968,2021-07-08T08:52:14Z,NA,NA,NA,We'll get it when available
37618,R3ID037968,2021-11-14T11:33:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, my whole family got it"
37619,R3ID037968,2021-12-08T08:59:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it
37624,R3ID037973,2021-05-13T12:46:56Z,NA,NA,NA,Have gotten it
37626,R3ID037973,2021-07-07T14:18:48Z,NA,NA,NA,Have it
37631,R3ID037976,2021-03-17T12:19:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I am pro-vaccine. Although I am in no hurry to receive the shot. I am mostly young and healthy. I do promote it to my older family that I feel it would be much more beneficial to them
37632,R3ID037976,2021-04-15T11:24:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure. I have been contemplating getting it but will not get it for my children anytime soon.
37633,R3ID037976,2021-07-07T11:43:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Have not gotten it. Not against it either. Possibly will get it within a year or so. Just figured since I?m somewhat young and healthy I?d wait it out first.
37635,R3ID037976,2021-10-13T09:37:46Z,NA,NA,NA,Still a little weary of it as it is something new but I have gotten the first shot. I got back in two weeks for the second one.

37758,R3ID038027,2021-06-10T08:03:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I was going to get it but the Johnson version causing blood clots has delayed my getting one
37760,R3ID038027,2021-11-12T21:53:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have not gotten it yet but I am not an anti vaccine person. I found out I was pregnant right when the vaccine started to be available to the public and I have had miscarriages and the issues with the vaccines (blood clots, only giving a few months of immunity) have kept me from wanting to get it.

37792,R3ID038037,2021-09-15T16:47:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I might get it after I deliver my secind child in December
37794,R3ID038037,2021-10-14T08:19:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I would like to wait until after I deliver my baby

38407,R3ID038301,2021-05-12T14:37:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I need more research. More trials and evaluation of how the vaccine effects every part of the body.

38487,R3ID038327,2021-10-13T08:38:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I have reservations about the effectiveness of the vaccine and the long-term effects of the  vaccine. I haven't received the vaccine yet.

38492,R3ID038328,2021-04-14T07:05:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and have taken my first dose
38493,R3ID038328,2021-05-12T07:35:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it and can't wait for the kids to get it too!
38495,R3ID038328,2021-07-07T08:06:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I want my kids to get it as soon as they are eligible to

38515,R3ID038336,2021-04-14T09:20:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am getting my second shot this weekend. I am nervous about the lack of research for the vaccine in pregnant and lactating women, but still decided to get vaccinated so that I can stop isolating"
38517,R3ID038336,2021-09-15T08:12:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"We are vaccinated. I plan to vaccinate my child, although I am nervous about it."

38520,R3ID038337,2021-04-14T12:55:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel it is safe
38521,R3ID038337,2021-09-15T11:21:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe and fairly effective; even if it's not 100% it is worth it to mitigate the risk. I got the vaccine as soon as it was allowed for my age and health bracket.
38522,R3ID038337,2021-11-11T00:17:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s safe and effective enough to ti be worth it.
38529,R3ID038339,2021-11-10T15:56:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received the vaccine.  I'm not sure it's completely safe and I worry about long term side effects, but I also didn't want to die from COVID."
38534,R3ID038340,2021-09-15T11:59:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is effective enough that it is worth getting to help stop the spread.
38535,R3ID038340,2021-10-13T09:12:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is the best option available.
38537,R3ID038340,2021-12-08T09:24:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's slightly effective, but not to the extent it's being advertised. I still plan on getting it when I have the time, although I don't have a lot of hope in it's promises."
38542,R3ID038341,2021-09-16T17:37:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got it, feel it is safe"
38549,R3ID038344,2021-07-07T09:59:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Undecided
38559,R3ID038346,2021-04-15T07:59:18Z,NA,NA,NA,For my child still determining

38571,R3ID038347,2021-04-14T11:26:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Honestly if I'm starting to feel a little better now that I'm seeing people that I've asked evening to taking the vaccine and being okay but I'm still not police sure about it I would like you to be tested further and see some of the long-term effects of the vaccine before I expose my family to it
38574,R3ID038347,2021-09-15T15:55:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I am very concerned about the vaccine. It doesn't seem safe or effective.  And i am concerned about the long-term effects it may have. It is too new for meand very unpredictable.  I just feel they do not have enough information on testing time to truly understand the vaccine and its effects. The trails didnt last long enough . I prefer not to be a test subject. I didnt sign up to be part of an unknow study.
38577,R3ID038347,2021-12-12T07:44:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm very unsure of the vaccine it doesn't seem very safe they haven't had enough time to truly study it in the effects of the the long-term effects and from what I'm saying it doesn't really work it's not stopping anyone from Catching the covid
38579,R3ID038349,2021-03-17T21:41:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm on the fence but I did just get my first dose od moderna.
38582,R3ID038349,2021-07-09T14:28:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I recieved it and older children did.  I believe its effective.
38586,R3ID038350,2021-04-14T07:22:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not be getting it. There is not enough research about long term side effects
38589,R3ID038350,2021-07-07T09:22:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Way too much unknown. My family will not be getting it
38591,R3ID038350,2021-12-14T13:57:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m skeptical. It all seemed to happen so fast and the long term side effects are so unknown. It?s scary. Especially when it doesn?t even fully protect you from Covid. I do not plan on getting it at this time.
38597,R3ID038352,2021-06-09T16:21:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten my vaccine and I would do it again in a hearbeat! I believe in the science and data behind the vaccine.
38599,R3ID038352,2021-11-10T09:43:41Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both vaccinated and we believe strongly in the vaccine's effectiveness. We are looking forward to the day when our son will be approved for a vaccine (he is currently too young).
38607,R3ID038354,2021-05-12T09:30:02Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
38609,R3ID038354,2021-10-13T08:14:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been vaccinated. I would rather deal with the possible side effects than possibly die leaving my kids or get someone else sick
38617,R3ID038356,2021-06-10T16:16:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I intend to get it for my kids as soon as it is available. My spouse and myself are currently fully vaccinated
38619,R3ID038356,2021-12-13T02:13:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is the most effective tool we have in our fight against COVID. I have gotten my full 2 shot series plus my booster.
38622,R3ID038357,2021-03-17T08:46:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I will be getting it soon.
38624,R3ID038357,2021-04-15T10:42:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel they are safe and effective

38627,R3ID038357,2021-09-16T08:53:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received it and believe it is safe.
38629,R3ID038357,2021-12-08T15:51:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and have already received it and the booster.

38642,R3ID038365,2021-07-08T08:11:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have it. I think its helpful for everyone to get.
38646,R3ID038367,2021-04-14T12:11:12Z,NA,NA,NA,We are not getting the vaccine
38649,R3ID038367,2021-07-07T08:03:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it was made too quickly. I?m not getting it.
38653,R3ID038368,2021-09-15T18:09:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Given how short the study period has been for the vaccine thus far I am concerned about long term side affects that could start being seen in the future.  I have several friends who have gotten the vaccine and developed rapid growths in benign tumors (one of which died within 2 weeks of the vaccine) and I have that same diagnosis which makes me wary.
38655,R3ID038369,2021-05-14T05:54:58Z,NA,NA,NA,No plans to get it as I feel it?s development was rushed.
38660,R3ID038372,2021-03-17T09:15:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it seems safe and effective, however I am not currently going to get it, as I am pregnant, and I don't see enough clinical trial data for pregnant women. I promote getting the vaccine among my family though."
38671,R3ID038374,2021-09-16T13:51:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I didn't want to get it but im pregnant and my doctor told me it would protect my unborn child when he is born
38673,R3ID038374,2021-10-13T11:06:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Im not so sure they work and hopefully dont have side effects.
38676,R3ID038374,2021-12-08T09:37:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I didn't want to get it because it was too new and I wanted to wait as long as possible to get it.  The only reason  got it is because I was pregnant and the doctor told me that the baby would be born with some protection against covid and since we were going to be in the hospital a few days, I wanted us to be protected. I got the vaccine about 2 weeks before giving birth."
38680,R3ID038375,2021-03-18T12:23:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in modern science and my household will be getting the vaccine as soon as we can
38682,R3ID038375,2021-06-10T00:56:25Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are fully vaccinated.
38688,R3ID038376,2021-03-17T18:55:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Im unsure but am feeling more positive about it
38713,R3ID038389,2021-06-09T09:28:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m grateful that it is available. I received it already. It?s especially comforting to me because I know it also helps my child stay well because I am not likely to get Covid-19.
38716,R3ID038389,2021-09-15T13:34:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe. It is carefully reviewed and tested before being given out freely. I got mine and plan to have my child vaccinated if it becomes available.
38717,R3ID038389,2021-10-14T21:10:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safe and at least effective enough that it?s worth having. So I got it.
38719,R3ID038389,2021-11-15T14:57:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m grateful for it and trust that it can and is at least helping the general population.
38727,R3ID038398,2021-04-15T15:39:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I got my first shot.
38733,R3ID038400,2021-05-13T12:26:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure.
38734,R3ID038400,2021-07-09T08:08:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Still unsure. Other health issues play into our decision
38740,R3ID038402,2021-03-17T08:57:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I haven't thought a lot about safety and effectiveness. I just want to get it.
38743,R3ID038403,2021-09-16T00:49:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Not planning to get it. Rushed and dont feel comfortable
38748,R3ID038405,2021-12-08T10:26:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safety is unknown. I am nervous about how it will effect me personally. I was pregnant when the vaccine cm was first available to me and now I?m breastfeeding. I?m worried about how it could affect my child. I also have already had Covid so I hope I have some immunity. I may still receive the vaccine, I?m undecided still."
38754,R3ID038408,2021-04-15T13:58:41Z,NA,NA,NA,Im getting it
38758,R3ID038410,2021-03-17T10:30:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure
38764,R3ID038411,2021-09-15T08:39:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very safe, fully vaccinated"
38765,R3ID038411,2021-10-13T08:13:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and effective; fully vaccinated
38767,R3ID038411,2021-11-10T12:08:50Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and effective. Fully vaccinated
38778,R3ID038414,2021-11-15T18:07:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe. I am vaccinated.
38782,R3ID038415,2021-05-13T20:07:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not feel enough studies have been completed. My family and I have no plans on getting it.
38784,R3ID038415,2021-07-08T08:04:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Not getting it
38788,R3ID038416,2021-06-10T21:22:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don?t think it?s safe, not enough research for long term effects"
38790,R3ID038416,2021-10-13T09:54:04Z,NA,NA,NA,Not to sure yet
38791,R3ID038416,2021-11-10T09:30:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m not sure
38796,R3ID038418,2021-04-14T09:37:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I will get the vaccine.
38799,R3ID038419,2021-03-18T13:37:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure. There are a lot of unkown elements surrounding it. However I have received my first dose.
38801,R3ID038419,2021-11-14T20:34:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust that the vaccine is safe and effective. I am hesitant regarding its long term effects. I currently am fully vaccinated.
38805,R3ID038420,2021-07-08T09:41:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I just don't think there is enough information or long term information about it.
38808,R3ID038422,2021-06-09T11:47:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Extremely safe and I have already gotten it
38810,R3ID038422,2021-09-15T08:59:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is very effective and I have already received it
38812,R3ID038422,2021-10-13T18:12:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten both doses and am confident in it?s effectiveness.
38814,R3ID038422,2021-12-08T09:56:30Z,NA,NA,NA,It is extremely safe and effective and I have already received it.
38821,R3ID038426,2021-07-07T08:44:14Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both COVID vaccinated
38822,R3ID038426,2021-10-14T08:54:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got mine vaccine in March 2021
38829,R3ID038428,2021-07-07T09:41:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I still want to know long term effects
38831,R3ID038428,2021-09-15T13:43:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm still unsure of it
38836,R3ID038429,2021-06-09T13:25:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I have taken the covid 19 vaccine.
38841,R3ID038432,2021-07-07T09:42:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t know how I feel
38848,R3ID038434,2021-09-15T11:29:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it.
38849,R3ID038434,2021-10-13T10:21:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it.
38850,R3ID038434,2021-11-15T14:46:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is worrisome to me. Anytime someone I know has an issue with the vaccine it seems like they're ignored, shamed, or bullied into not talking about it, agreeing it must be due to something else, etcetera.  They say vaccines can't do any harm and it's always just coincidence.  That's troubling.  If anyone even asks if anybody has experienced issues with the vaccines they are shut down.  The flow of info is horribly restricted.  I know people who are experiencing issues months after the vaccines.  I don't trust our FDA or government in general at this point.  Something is not right."
38853,R3ID038435,2021-03-17T09:56:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not getting it. There?s still too much unknown at the moment. I am still breastfeeding and my lactation consultant recommended not getting it until they had more data on what the impact was to breastmilk and my baby
38854,R3ID038435,2021-04-15T05:08:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t trust it right now. I want to see long term side  effects before taking it. Especially with AstroZenica and J&J having sudden issues after distribution started
38855,R3ID038435,2021-05-13T13:50:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s effective and safe for the general public. I?m not getting it until more research is done on pregnant and breastfeeding women as I?m still breastfeeding my child and I?ve had doctors tell me to hold off on the vaccine until we know more about it.
38859,R3ID038435,2021-09-15T14:37:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have the first shot. Didn?t want to get it. I wanted to wait to see more studies on its potential long term impacts on people, fertility, etc. I eventually had to get it or my work threatened every time I was exposed i would have to go on unpaid leave."
38863,R3ID038436,2021-06-11T17:55:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s safe already getting it
38864,R3ID038436,2021-07-09T15:34:34Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe I got it
38865,R3ID038436,2021-11-10T10:09:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I have it think it?s good
38866,R3ID038436,2021-12-14T16:58:35Z,NA,NA,NA,All in my household vaccinated hopefully it helps
38872,R3ID038439,2021-03-18T16:48:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safer than the virus.
38873,R3ID038439,2021-04-16T08:15:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the pfizer and moderna shots are relatively safe. I have already received the vaccine
38876,R3ID038439,2021-07-08T15:12:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it was tested extensively. I was nervous about it, but got it when I was able and have had no problems."
38878,R3ID038439,2021-10-13T11:58:29Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel normal amount of apprehension but trust the science
38885,R3ID038440,2021-04-14T07:06:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine. I think the potential risks of the vaccine are worth the benefit
38889,R3ID038440,2021-09-16T08:12:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it and believe it is safe and effective
38896,R3ID038441,2021-03-18T01:21:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Plan is to not get it.  There are no long term studies on it. I'm pregnant and do not feel safe to get it.
38903,R3ID038444,2021-04-15T14:19:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Im not entirely sure how i feel about the vaccine. Im hoping it works well and will help get everything back to normal. I dont plan to get it since right now i am pregnant but i may get it after.
38905,R3ID038444,2021-09-16T10:53:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten the vaccine but im disappointed in the fact that many places still require masks even with the vaccine. Plus the effectiveness from what ive heard isnt significant
38907,R3ID038444,2021-12-08T16:15:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten my first 2 doses but I am unsure of how I feel about the effectiveness, as to you can still get the virus it just won't be as severe, which is definitely good but I wish It was more affective"
38911,R3ID038445,2021-07-08T08:07:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it
38914,R3ID038446,2021-07-08T09:44:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe and effective and got it in April.
38917,R3ID038448,2021-03-17T13:30:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I am a bit unsure about the safety of the vaccine and I plan to get it but not right away.
38921,R3ID038449,2021-07-08T08:09:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I've had both doses. I'm glad they're is a vaccine available and wish more people would receive it
38930,R3ID038452,2021-05-12T07:03:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel like it is still in a trial and has not been out long enough to know the long term effects, especially for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and their babies."
38931,R3ID038452,2021-12-08T09:44:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am unsure. I am worried about it effecting my fertility. I don?t currently have plans to get it, but my husband will be getting it this month for college."
38938,R3ID038458,2021-04-14T09:26:37Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got my first dose and excited for the second one
38945,R3ID038460,2021-06-10T12:43:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I got vaccinated and am glad I did
38947,R3ID038460,2021-07-07T11:58:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine
38952,R3ID038461,2021-09-15T12:38:33Z,NA,NA,NA,The number say that it is safer to get the vaccine than it is to get COVID so I?m a firm believer in the vaccine.  I believe that the mRNA vaccines are safe and effective but the J&J shot makes me nervous. Everyone eligible in our household has been vaccinated.
38954,R3ID038461,2021-10-13T11:05:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received both vaccine doses and plan to get a booster shot when it is available.  The MRNA vaccines are safe and effective.  The J&J shot makes me a bit nervous.
38960,R3ID038465,2021-06-09T11:24:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Already received
38961,R3ID038465,2021-10-14T08:13:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it and think it?s working good
38967,R3ID038468,2021-04-14T07:15:07Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are both fully vaccinated. It is safe and effective
38968,R3ID038468,2021-05-12T07:39:52Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe and I've gotten it
38969,R3ID038468,2021-06-09T12:08:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective and I'm vaccinated
38970,R3ID038468,2021-07-07T09:06:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Safe and effective and I'm vaccinated
38972,R3ID038468,2021-09-15T08:28:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I have it. It is safe and effective
38977,R3ID038470,2021-04-14T09:40:51Z,NA,NA,NA,Weary of it being soon to vaccinate at such a high demand. Case studies
38979,R3ID038470,2021-06-09T14:08:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Needs more research but time will tell
38984,R3ID038470,2021-11-10T20:49:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I have some doubts- like all vaccines
38985,R3ID038470,2021-12-08T19:21:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Very skeptical. I am personally fully vaccinated for other reasons but hesitant to long term and for my children
38988,R3ID038472,2021-11-10T12:21:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I have serious concerns about the safety and long-term effectiveness of the vaccine due to the data coming out of the UK and Israel as well as the silencing of any voices that ask questions. I don't feel comfortable commenting on my plans.
39003,R3ID038477,2021-07-09T14:45:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"We got the shots, but think the risks are downplayed."
39005,R3ID038477,2021-10-14T08:05:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Have gotten it. Still unsure of efficacy and long-term safety.
39009,R3ID038479,2021-06-09T20:26:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I have recieved the COVID-19 vaccine myself.
39010,R3ID038479,2021-07-07T10:35:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I will feel confident it is safe for my children once more testing is complete.
39012,R3ID038479,2021-09-15T10:37:28Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe. I already have it.
39023,R3ID038486,2021-03-17T11:10:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I wish I could get it sooner
39024,R3ID038486,2021-04-14T10:38:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I am getting it on Monday.  So excited!
39027,R3ID038486,2021-11-10T13:14:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as I could because there is so much evidence that it is safe and effective.
39028,R3ID038486,2021-12-10T08:06:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it immediately because I knew it was safe and effective.
39045,R3ID038488,2021-09-15T08:43:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine and wasn't concerned. I am however worried about my daughter who is 23 months receiving it.
39047,R3ID038488,2021-10-14T08:15:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust it and will get it for my child as well.
39049,R3ID038488,2021-12-08T12:21:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got the first 2 vaccinations, and even though my husband and I caught Delta and were sick, we both intend on getting the booster shot as soon as the doctor says it's okay. I feel now more than ever, especially after being sick myself, that the vaccine is FAR LESS terrifying than having Covid without it. Any small doubts or worries I had prior are gone since being sick."
39052,R3ID038489,2021-11-13T03:38:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don?t feel it?s been around long enough to determine if there are any long term effects from it, and would like to wait"
39057,R3ID038491,2021-10-14T10:43:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received three shots, my spouse has received two doses and our kids will get it when it's available for their age."
39064,R3ID038496,2021-03-17T10:33:59Z,NA,NA,NA,"Unsure of its safety and effectiveness, especially for mothers who are pregnant and/or nursing and for people who are young and low risk"
39066,R3ID038496,2021-05-13T13:51:57Z,NA,NA,NA,"I would like more data, especially longer term data before considering getting it"
39069,R3ID038496,2021-09-15T10:19:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it needs more postmarket research and that some of the stats are skewed or cherry picked for political reasons
39074,R3ID038498,2021-06-09T20:12:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I hope it?s effective and feel that it?s safe.
39075,R3ID038498,2021-09-16T17:38:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I'm not concerned about its safety. I'm concerned about its effectiveness and the lack of a booster for the J&J.
39076,R3ID038498,2021-10-13T18:37:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe for 12+, I got mine."
39077,R3ID038498,2021-11-10T17:27:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's safe and mostly effective. I got the J&J shot with a Moderna booster.
39078,R3ID038498,2021-12-09T19:10:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it?s as safe as any other vaccine and I plan on getting them for as long as they are needed
39081,R3ID038499,2021-03-17T10:01:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Getting it when available
39083,R3ID038499,2021-04-14T09:05:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I've changed my mind and will not be getting it yet, possibly in the future but not sure"

39093,R3ID038500,2021-09-16T10:34:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it immediately
39102,R3ID038503,2021-03-17T12:07:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, we plan to get it"
39103,R3ID038503,2021-04-15T15:34:53Z,NA,NA,NA,We will get it
39110,R3ID038507,2021-03-17T11:18:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about the vaccine and already gotten both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
39112,R3ID038507,2021-10-13T15:24:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective. My spouse and I are fully vaccinated and intend on vaccinating our 2.5 y/o as soon as he is eligible.
39119,R3ID038509,2021-03-18T12:20:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust that its safe yet.
39120,R3ID038509,2021-04-14T16:44:01Z,NA,NA,NA,Skeptical but needed
39121,R3ID038509,2021-09-15T10:02:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I already received both doses
39133,R3ID038513,2021-03-19T13:06:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Uncertain of the long term impacts and the amount of time taken to push it through for EUA
39141,R3ID038516,2021-10-13T10:50:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe in what my doctor tells me to do, but I do not trust big pharma or our government mandating it."
39144,R3ID038517,2021-07-07T11:04:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it in December of 2020 as a health care worker
39147,R3ID038518,2021-03-17T09:34:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am on the fence. We largely choose not to vaccinate right now based on the risk vs benefits of the vaccines available and the illnesses they prevent. However, Covid-19 is new and obviously deadly. I'm still trying to decide if we (adults) will take the vaccine, and if so-- which one. While I know that the reccomendation is (take whatever you can get, as soon as you can get it) that doesn't work for myself.or my family."

39785,R3ID038728,2021-03-17T18:28:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel hesitant about getting it for my family since it only decreases symptoms which would already likely be mild.

40139,R3ID038830,2021-11-14T10:33:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it and intend to get a booster. I believe it is safe and effective
40140,R3ID038830,2021-12-12T08:55:22Z,NA,NA,NA,It is safe for adults and I have gotten it and plan to get a booster.
40144,R3ID038833,2021-06-11T08:24:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine and my kids will get the vaccine when they are able to except the baby. I have concerns about the safety of the vaccine for her because she is under two.
40149,R3ID038836,2021-06-10T09:55:52Z,NA,NA,NA,Waiting a little while
40157,R3ID038840,2021-12-10T04:51:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m still not okay with getting vaccinated. I don?t know what?s in it and vaccinated people are still getting sick too much
40166,R3ID038843,2021-05-12T07:05:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm still very unsure about it. I need to research it more myself. I have many friends who have gotten sick from it. Sicker than how we had covid I know everybody is affected by the disease and the shot differently
40167,R3ID038843,2021-07-07T08:21:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I may get it but I want to wait. I don't feel like it's been out long enough to know the side effects
40170,R3ID038843,2021-12-08T12:32:28Z,NA,NA,NA,We may get it in time. I would like to see more longitude research
40179,R3ID038844,2021-09-15T09:38:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Trusted
40182,R3ID038844,2021-11-10T09:15:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Mostly safe and effective. We are already vaccinated
40183,R3ID038844,2021-12-14T13:33:37Z,NA,NA,NA,Have already received vaccine
40187,R3ID038846,2021-04-14T07:19:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten both doses (Pfizer) and view it as safe. When approved, we plan to vaccinate our daughter."
40189,R3ID038846,2021-05-12T08:47:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I am all for it and have received both doses of Pfizer. I can't wait for it to be available for children
40190,R3ID038846,2021-06-09T10:09:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received both doses, as has my husband. We feel very comfortable and are very pro-vax, generally."
40192,R3ID038846,2021-09-15T08:58:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I am all for it and have gotten both doses and plan to do so for our child

40201,R3ID038849,2021-12-08T13:38:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and need our boosters and will get them. 
We are working in getting the kids vaccinated as well"
40203,R3ID038850,2021-06-09T11:10:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m concerned about long term effects as we don?t have long term studies, but I think the benefits outweighs the risk. I am fully vaccinated."
40207,R3ID038852,2021-03-19T16:21:15Z,NA,NA,NA,"I just received mine. I'm still a bit nervous about it, because I do not know how effective it is. The doctors and scientists never give definite answers as to what the shot exactly does, other than to say it lessens symptoms."
40208,R3ID038852,2021-04-16T12:29:49Z,NA,NA,NA,"I received the second dose yesterday. I don't know how effective it is, because the experts claim to not know exactly how it will work. I took it as a precaution, and I hope that it really does work."
40209,R3ID038852,2021-05-14T18:35:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I still don't know how effective it is. I received it, but the isn't much info given on how reliable it is."
40210,R3ID038852,2021-11-12T14:07:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have been vaccinated. I don't feel that it's 100% safe, because it has been known to cause blood clots. But for the most part, I feel the vaccine is ok. As far as it's effectiveness, I feel that it's not at effective as it should be. People can still contract the virus, and spread the virus just as easily as someone who isn't vaccinated. Someone vaccinated can have no symptoms, and unknowingly spread the virus to others. I also know someone who died of COVID even after being vaccinated. I have been vaccinated, but I'm not an advocate of it."
40213,R3ID038854,2021-04-15T13:34:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"Still some concerns about unknown long-term effects, but hopefully overall safe and plan to receive later"
40217,R3ID038855,2021-10-14T08:40:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe that the vaccines are safe and very important.  All eligible immediate family were vaccinated as soon as able.
40220,R3ID038856,2021-05-12T07:39:27Z,NA,NA,NA,Absolutely would never get it. It has not been tested long term and I am concerned for the effects specifically for women of reproductive age .
40221,R3ID038856,2021-06-10T08:57:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Absolutely has not been tested long enough to be deemed safe
40223,R3ID038856,2021-10-13T08:33:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Absolutely will not get it. My physician does not recommend it. I would potentially get it in the future when it?s been out longer but I?m not going to be a guinea pig
40224,R3ID038856,2021-11-10T09:14:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not plan to get it, I am not comfortable with its safety and effectiveness long term. Maybe in a few years, I would consider it, but not right now. I will not be a guinea pig for it. The thing is, after talking with multiple doctors, nurses, therapists, etc throughout our family member's COVID hospitalization (which has been ongoing since August), there are a lot of people dying who are vaccinated. My doctor does NOT recommend the vaccine."
40232,R3ID038860,2021-03-17T22:44:47Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure about. I?m a nursing mother and my ONGYN recommended I not get it while nursing so will likely wait 10 months until I am finished nursing
40235,R3ID038861,2021-05-12T10:23:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust it, and plan to get it."

40247,R3ID038864,2021-03-17T21:20:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the vaccine
40254,R3ID038865,2021-12-14T14:08:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I worry about it?s lack of testing or more importantly the validity of the testing that has been pushed through for political reasons. I did however receive the vaccine to protect my infant daughter.
40256,R3ID038867,2021-05-12T19:29:18Z,NA,NA,NA,Both adults in our household have gotten vaccinated. Eagerly looking forward to approval for younger kids. Very confident in safety. Worried about effectiveness against emerging variants and mutation pressure to skirt vaccines given poor/slow worldwide rollout.
40261,R3ID038868,2021-11-15T17:48:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I just had my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I felt some side effects but I am not too worried except when I hear stories about how other people had some serious side effects

My husband was a COVID trial participant and has been vaccinated since Nov 2020. I was vaccinated as soon as I was eligible in April 2021. My kids will get vaccinated once it is approved for their age group.
40270,R3ID038869,2021-10-15T09:52:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and effective. Myself and spouse were vaccinated early (husband actually participated in a trial before it was approved). Children will get it when able/old enough.
40271,R3ID038869,2021-11-10T09:08:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very safe and effective. Myself and my husband are full vaxxed and just received boosters.

40329,R3ID038888,2021-04-14T07:32:03Z,NA,NA,NA,With the J&J recall I?m not as confident in getting it. I still plan to do so but will probably wait it out.

The science of it is not just to protect one person it?s to protect an entire population and when the vast majority don?t follow through it limits the efficacy. I have received the vaccine and plan to have my older child receive it also. When available my younger child age 0-5 will also receive it because it is the right thing to do for ourselves and others.

40771,R3ID039018,2021-10-13T19:29:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Very concerned regarding the safety and effectiveness due to the politicization of the vaccine. I was required to get the vaccine for work so I did not have the freedom to make a decision about my own health unless I wanted to lose the income my family depends on.
40774,R3ID039018,2021-12-08T12:40:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Because the lines between public health, politics, and business have been blurred as a result of this pandemic, I have a difficult time fully trusting the Covid-19 vaccine in terms of its safety and effectiveness. I do not care for the propaganda the media has been using to push the vaccine and it makes me question the true motives behind why the vaccine is being pushed in the way that it is. Although the ""science"" that is behind the vaccine today may be showing that it is safe and effective, it could potentially be ""science"" in the future that shows unforeseen long term effects or even ineffectiveness. I was vaccinated simply because I was required to be for work. With that say, I am absolutely opposed to any form of vaccine mandate and it is very likely that I would still be unvaccinated today had it not be required. I have not seen any evidence that the vaccine is effective in preventing someone from contracting Covid-19. Rather, I look at it as a means of protecting oneself from a severe and potentially fatal form of the virus. However, the survival rate for the virus is already over 99%. As a healthy adult with no underlying health issues, I do not see an overwhelming need for the vaccine. You can still spread Covid-19 even when vaccinated so I am not buying into the argument that you are getting the vaccine to protect others. There are so many hypocritical arguments and overwhelming inconsistencies regarding Covid-19 protocols and restrictions that at this point it is hard to trust anything related to the pandemic. Look at the stands jam packed with people standing and sitting on top of each other at sporting events on television. These people are unmasked because they are outdoors and screaming and yelling while cheering on their team. The ""science"" says that because they are outdoors there is minimal risk of spreading Covid. You can't tell me that saliva isn't being released into the air and germs not spreading simply because they are outside. Yet children i"

I believe we have a responsibility to society to get vaccinated and slow the spread of this disease while protecting those who truly are too medically fragile for vaccinations or too young. I'm completely exhausted by the anti-mask, anti vaccine political agenda that is causing covid to continue to surge in my community.

41058,R3ID039128,2021-11-10T10:15:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I got my shots as soon as I could. My husband too. I talked my parents into getting them. I can?t wait for my son to be eligible.

41292,R3ID039209,2021-05-12T11:06:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe the numerous scientists who have been candid about both the vaccine's efficacy and its safety relative to its newness, and I have receive both doses of the Pfizer vaccine at this point."

41313,R3ID039217,2021-03-17T10:12:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not want to get the vaccine while pregnant due to lack or study on pregnant women

41341,R3ID039226,2021-12-08T09:11:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten 2 full doses and a booster of the Pfizer vaccine so far.  I believe it to be fully safe, wonderfully effective, and necessary for us to get out of this pandemic."
41345,R3ID039228,2021-06-09T09:52:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel confident in the science of the COVID-19 vaccine. Both my husband and I have received 2 doses of Moderna.
41349,R3ID039229,2021-04-14T08:09:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is very important for people to get it when they can.  I have already received both shots.
41354,R3ID039229,2021-11-10T11:22:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe that it is safe and effective in preventing someone from getting severe covid symptoms but it does not prevent the virus from entirely spreading.  I have gotten both shots and plan to get the booster soon.
41367,R3ID039233,2021-11-11T19:30:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Got it as soon as eligible and feel positive about its reduction of risk to health. Not no risk but benefit outweigh risks.

41395,R3ID039241,2021-12-10T10:04:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the first shot and still need to get a second. I feel unsure about effectiveness because I got the first shot (after I had already had COVID a year prior) and then got COVID a second time during the window in which I was supposed to get the second shot. I realize it?s preventing many illnesses or at least reducing severity on a larger scale though. Seems like we will continue having to get shots for a long time to keep up antibodies.
41397,R3ID039242,2021-04-15T14:37:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I am so grateful for the vaccine and trust it completely.

Many of my older relatives have gotten the booster. My son has an appointment to get his first vaccine. My daughter will get the vaccine when she is old enough. I view the vaccine like a flu shot. It may not make us completely immune, but it will help to decrease symptoms, hopefully help us to not have the virus again, and slow the spread."
41417,R3ID039250,2021-12-13T09:29:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"All of the adults in our family have recieved 2 vaccines, and many have recieved boosters. I feel that the vaccine is on par with a flu shot. It wont prevent all cases, but it is our best chance at preventing more serious cases and deaths."

41429,R3ID039254,2021-04-14T07:21:18Z,NA,NA,NA,Shot 2 this Sunday. I feel very happy and confident of the safety. I have a friend that is a cancer research scientist that explained the new vaccine science.

41502,R3ID039282,2021-12-12T10:38:22Z,NA,NA,NA,It's not effective if you have to get indefinite boosters. It's not safe if it's causing deaths in all age groups. Hard pass.

42191,R3ID039546,2021-06-09T12:21:29Z,NA,NA,NA,Both my husband and I have been vaccinated. Our children are too young to get it at this point.
42193,R3ID039547,2021-07-08T19:36:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I received it mainly to not prohibit me from traveling or not complying with possible regulations.
42196,R3ID039547,2021-10-13T22:34:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am vaccinated mainly out of convenience, meaning I won?t need to get it last minute if it is required for traveling or an event. I?m not sure about how safe it is or not. I?m not too worried. The vaccine was worse for me than Covid."
42198,R3ID039547,2021-12-10T20:13:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it out of convenience. I had Covid and if it weren?t for travel and other restrictions I probably would not have got the vaccine.
42200,R3ID039548,2021-06-09T09:08:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as I could. I trust the science and want to be part of the solution.
42203,R3ID039548,2021-11-10T09:58:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I are fully vaccinated and boosted, we work in schools. Our 5-11 year olds get their first shots tomorrow. When the vaccine is approved for our 2 year old he will get it as well. The vaccines are recommended by doctors and scientists as safe and effective."
42209,R3ID039553,2021-05-12T11:48:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I wish my baby could get the vaccine. The whole society is going back to normal and I can?t protect her anymore. No one cares since the old people can get vaccinated. I feel stupid we worked so hard to follow the procedures to protect society and as soon as those who have economic value can get vaccinated( the adults) there are no more protections for children. I feel like it is pretty impossible to protect my daughter from Covid anymore. I am frustrated that science decided that children were such a vulnerable group that they had to be protected from vaccine research so now they will be a year out on getting a vaccine for children. This  results in children being in the most danger for the longest time. Hardly seems moral to me and I just don?t think I can keep her safe anymore since everyone just wants things back to normal.
42210,R3ID039553,2021-06-10T11:13:30Z,NA,NA,NA,Want to get it.

I feel like the COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe, but this opinion is based on the limited data and reports available in the short period of time since they were tested, then made available. I think it is too soon to judge their effectiveness."

The evidence was limited, but promising, and I figured there is never going to be a large enough sample size to understand effects specific to pregnancy unless people like me are willing to step up and contribute to the research. Since getting the vaccine I have noticed that I feel a lot less anxious and stressed about a lot of things because I do believe there is clear evidence for it's effectiveness."

42402,R3ID039624,2021-12-09T13:14:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got my shot in the spring as a teacher I was eligible before others and I definitely got it.  When I had the chance to get a booster, I got that.  All of my children that can get vaccinated are in the process/or are fully vaccinated.  My partner is also fully vaccinated and getting his booster next week.  Our plans is to get it until something dictates otherwise."

42438,R3ID039643,2021-11-10T20:39:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust that it is safe and did receive two doses already. Know that children aged 5 and older are eligible, I will most likely have my older children vaccinated as well, although I?m not rushing to be the first family to do so."
42440,R3ID039643,2021-12-14T13:14:08Z,NA,NA,NA,My spouse and I have received it and felt that for us the benefits outweighed any risks. Our children are not yet vaccinated and we are waiting a bit to make sure it is safe for them.
42443,R3ID039645,2021-05-13T13:29:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel very comfortable with the vaccine in terms of safety and effectiveness.  I already received my vaccines in December and January.

42515,R3ID039664,2021-07-08T19:47:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as I was able to and would have my children due the same. I think it has been shown to be safe and effective
42516,R3ID039664,2021-12-14T19:24:23Z,NA,NA,NA,"At the very onset of COVID-19, I had concerns about it?s safety given the rush and that the president seemed willing to push it through when he has shown no respect for science. By the time the vaccine came around, I was much more accepting of the vaccine and was one of the first people to get it in the county I worked from the public health office. I have been a strong advocate for it and have encouraged others to get it. At the time the Moderna booster was approved, I just tested positive for COVID-19 and so I could not get the booster, but I did as soon I was healthy and was able to fit it in my schedule. From personal experience, I can say that it greatly reduces the severity when you get COVID-19 and it also prevents it."
42518,R3ID039665,2021-07-09T09:07:14Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it and am grateful for it

42544,R3ID039674,2021-11-14T10:24:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm scared but getting more confident of it. We are vaxed but when the vaccine comes out for 2 year olds we will sign up if it looks legit, which im sure it will. We might not be 1st in line but will get it as soon as we feel comfortable."

42561,R3ID039681,2021-12-10T13:19:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s generally safe. I don?t think it?s effectiveness is as high as was hoped for. I got the vaccine but I am against forcing people to get it and I don?t want to get boosters every year. I don?t even get a flu shot every year.
42565,R3ID039683,2021-11-10T20:12:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already have it, my older child will get it too, trust that it is safe. Doctors in family are very supportive"
42572,R3ID039688,2021-10-15T06:20:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m fully vaccinated. I have some hesitancy but feel that the risks of COVID are far greater than the risks of the vaccine.

42585,R3ID039692,2021-09-15T09:40:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it. I think it is very important to help prevent it from spreading to those who are more likely to be hospitalized from getting sick with COVID.
42589,R3ID039696,2021-11-10T12:43:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine but am skeptical of having my kids receive it.  Don't feel that there's been eniugh studies done on their little bodies and for the most part healthy kids don't get too sick if they get covid

42764,R3ID039758,2021-12-10T08:17:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it but it need more long term and thorough studies. The booster needs more data.
42774,R3ID039764,2021-05-12T09:29:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. I?m glad to have it.

42794,R3ID039768,2021-09-15T09:44:23Z,NA,NA,NA,Fine
42796,R3ID039769,2021-11-15T18:56:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that it is safe and only partially effective, especially given that recent studies are displaying decreased efficacy after 6 months of inoculation. That is incredibly disconcerting and makes me wonder what the long term national and global effects of another covid-19 spike will do to our economies and mental health. I was already vaccinated and will continue to be if boosters become available."
42797,R3ID039769,2021-12-08T17:29:46Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is effective and as safe as possible for now. I have already received the vaccine.
42805,R3ID039776,2021-05-13T12:17:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, but more because I felt like I was going to be forced to, not because I wanted to"
42808,R3ID039778,2021-05-12T08:02:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I do not plan on getting it. COVID-19 is not personally a concern for me, so I do not want to add anything to my body for something I am not concerned about."

42829,R3ID039789,2021-06-09T09:11:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"I just had a baby 2.5 weeks ago and I was delaying getting the vaccine while pregnant because I didn't feel like I had done enough research, but I'm planning on getting it soon.  I'm breastfeeding so the baby will also benefit.  I'm also planning on pumping so my toddler will get some antibodies."
42842,R3ID039797,2021-06-09T23:03:19Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I were both vaccinated as soon as we became elligible. I don't fully understand the science of it but trust vaccines as they have been used for many years and trust medical professionals in general. I was slightly concerned because shortly after my J&J shot I heard about some women dying from blot clots and my current pregnancy put me in that risky category.
42849,R3ID039798,2021-12-14T21:12:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I have no plans on getting it.
42855,R3ID039800,2021-06-10T18:39:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident that it is safe and effective. I had my first dose recently and will get my second dose later this month.
42863,R3ID039804,2021-05-12T10:05:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received the vaccine. I felt slightly anxious about it, as I know it is new vaccine technology and there are not years of research for safety of this particular vaccine.

42872,R3ID039806,2021-11-12T09:58:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve received it already. I?m unsure about it?s long term effects but considering the alternative I was comfortable with taking it. Given the research it appears to be safe and effective and I trust the science. I did NOT get the J&J vaccine due to the effects on women.
42873,R3ID039806,2021-12-08T12:01:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is effective in preventing hospitalization and severe illness based on the research.  I feel it is safe right now.  I am concerned about the long term effects that we have no information on. I have received the vaccine.
42877,R3ID039809,2021-07-07T09:12:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure
42883,R3ID039811,2021-06-10T08:46:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe; benefits outweigh the risks to us.  My husband and I are fully vaccinated against COVID 19 and we plan on vaccinating all of our 4 children when it's available.
42893,R3ID039816,2021-05-12T13:56:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I will wait until my child is weaned.
42895,R3ID039816,2021-06-09T22:32:30Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure at this time
42897,R3ID039816,2021-07-08T11:40:24Z,NA,NA,NA,It's too soon to tell. Ask me in 5 years.
42902,R3ID039816,2021-09-15T19:55:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm not feeling safe, but I got it."
42904,R3ID039816,2021-10-14T11:25:29Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, and it is better than not having anything, but I would've preferred to let my natural immunity after covid suffice."
42906,R3ID039816,2021-11-12T15:02:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't think it's safe at all and with the absence of longitudinal studies, denial of vaccine-assiciated deaths and disabilities, and the inability to hold pharmaceutical companies liable for injuries, I will not be signing my child up."
42908,R3ID039816,2021-12-08T10:04:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't think it's safe. I have developed a sequelae of medical complications after COVID and developed new, more alarming chronic symptoms on top of the existing COVID-induced  issues after the vaccine"

42968,R3ID039845,2021-12-08T09:06:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe. Hopefully effective (it has been for us). I just got my booster shot and when my kids are old enough will be getting it for them.

43018,R3ID039866,2021-06-10T23:23:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the data shows that this far, the vaccine is a lot safer than getting COVID. Myself and my husband are both fully vaccinated. I would be hesitant to get the kids vaccinated (4 year old and 9 month old) because there isn?t data on this age range."
43019,R3ID039866,2021-07-07T08:13:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fairly confident about it?s short term effectiveness. Slightly nervous to see if there will be any long term effects just because we don?t have a ton of longitudinal data. Myself and my husband are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
43027,R3ID039873,2021-05-12T07:12:38Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaccinated

43658,R3ID040192,2021-11-15T15:01:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I got mind and I?m considering having my child get it
43668,R3ID040202,2021-07-07T12:36:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not plan to get it.I don?t feel it?s safe.
43670,R3ID040202,2021-12-09T00:05:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"No, not safe, no, not effective. I will not get it."
43676,R3ID040207,2021-07-08T14:46:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan on getting it and confident it will work for now.
43679,R3ID040208,2021-06-10T10:12:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it needs more testing for long term side effects. I have no plans to take the vaccine yet.
43690,R3ID040214,2021-07-09T15:45:02Z,NA,NA,NA,It's safe and it should be forced in the population.
43691,R3ID040214,2021-09-15T09:10:41Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe in science, and it's the best shot we got against the pandemic.  I also believe in the process, where proper studies will be done before the vaccine would be available."
43692,R3ID040214,2021-10-13T08:37:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's effective and everyone should have it so that my little kids don't have to wear masks.
43699,R3ID040220,2021-10-15T01:38:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine. I feel ok with it.
43706,R3ID040225,2021-11-16T09:15:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have not been a parent who does immunizations for myself,  nor my children.  I dont trust it. But i know my children are protected.  And i am unsure if i will get it. But the main thing is,  it should be my choice, not enforced upon  me"
43713,R3ID040231,2021-07-08T09:39:58Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it as soon as it was available to me. I am completely confident that everyone who can, should."
43721,R3ID040237,2021-09-15T08:48:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Im waiting because i dont feel like we know enough about it
43735,R3ID040250,2021-11-15T14:40:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I am worried about the safety and effectiveness. Myself and my fiance have gotten vaccinated but I am afraid to vaccinate my children .
43745,R3ID040255,2021-09-15T15:31:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. I already got vaccinated.
43776,R3ID040282,2021-11-10T09:01:15Z,NA,NA,NA,It should be a personal choice and not mandated. I?m hesitant because both of my children have previous vaccine injuries and also have MTHFR gene mutations.
43777,R3ID040282,2021-12-10T14:20:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it should be a personal choice if someone wants to receive it or not.  I am undecided on the vaccine.
43798,R3ID040298,2021-07-07T10:30:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Very good. Fully vaccinated
43814,R3ID040317,2021-10-13T08:02:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as soon as I could. It is safe and the best way to prevent the hospitalization of the most vulnerable.
43823,R3ID040322,2021-11-10T09:52:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is incredibly safe and effective, especially with the booster and with how quickly they formulated it and got it out to the public.

My fiancé and I have already gotten both of the first 2 shots. And, in 2 months, he will get his booster shot. In 3.5 weeks, I'm getting my booster shot."
43828,R3ID040326,2021-11-15T14:38:39Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already got my covid shot. However, my children are under 5 so they will not get it. even if they make one available for children under 5 I do not want my children to receive it. there have been too many issues going on with the shot."
43835,R3ID040332,2021-11-12T11:18:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am vaccinated, spouse is not.  I think the science is sound but it shouldn?t be forced.  There is no long term study so I understand the hesitancy."
43838,R3ID040334,2021-10-14T14:09:26Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, safe, please vaccinate my under 5s soon!"
43844,R3ID040336,2021-11-13T19:01:34Z,NA,NA,NA,It's proven to be safe. We have it. My child will get it as soon as it is available.
43847,R3ID040337,2021-12-08T10:14:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it is effective in decreasing an individual?s own symptoms, I don?t feel it is effective in decreasing transmission. I don?t feel there is enough data to know the safety at this point. I am not planning to get it at this time, other family members have gotten it."
43859,R3ID040348,2021-07-07T08:39:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I am enthusiastic about vaccine availability and I am fully vaxxed already.
43860,R3ID040348,2021-10-13T09:55:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe they are significantly effective in preventing infection and minimizing symptoms in breakthrough infections and i am fully vaccinated, as is my spouse and many of my family members."
43867,R3ID040351,2021-07-09T13:35:21Z,NA,NA,NA,"Confident in the vaccine, already recieved it"
43871,R3ID040351,2021-10-13T12:52:46Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe and confident that it works. Have already recieved the vaccine.
43873,R3ID040351,2021-12-14T13:18:09Z,NA,NA,NA,Everyone who is eligible in my family has recieved the vaccine as well as the appropriate boosters. We trust the vaccine and science. I am alittle concerned that there have been so many break trough cases as far as vaccine effectiveness.
43881,R3ID040355,2021-12-09T10:16:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is safe and effective. I plan on getting my booster shot soon. I also plan on having my daughter take the vaccine when her age group is eligible
43886,R3ID040357,2021-11-10T19:18:06Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is safe, and more effective than not getting it. I?ve grown less enthusiastic over time. Initially, we were told if we were vaccinated that we were unlikely to spread it and could resume normal life (for the most part). Over time, we realized it was less effective than touted, and we could still spread the virus. 

I am also very annoyed that this country refuses to acknowledge any nuance. Many/most other first world countries consider someone who had COVID and one shot of a 2 shot series to be fully vaccinated. A person who had COVID and one shot was shown to produce more antibodies than someone who?d never had COVID and got both shots. Because I had symptomatic, diagnosed COVID, I chose to only get one shot. Since the CDC refuses to acknowledge prior infection, I am considered ?unvaccinated? and will be subject to weekly testing and masking indefinitely under the new OSHA regulations. It is ridiculous. In many European  countries, I?d be considered fully vaccinated. We are supposed to ?trust the science? yet there is no acknowledgement of this scenario. It?s one-size-fits-all. It has made me very weary and wary of vaccine mandates when I was completely pro-vaccine before this."
43887,R3ID040357,2021-12-08T09:47:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's safe, but I'm disappointed that the effectiveness was oversold in the beginning. I understand there were a lot of unknowns, but it's disappointing to be told we are very unlikely to spread COVID if we get vaccinated and then find out it isn't necessarily true. At this point, it appears to be a solid tool to reduce severity of symptoms if infected, but less effective at eradicating COVID-19 like we were initially told (""do your part!"" propaganda). I received the vaccine, but don't have plans to get boosters since I've already had COVID."
43893,R3ID040358,2021-10-13T09:38:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated understanding that it dies not prevent but makes the symptoms less deadly
43899,R3ID040362,2021-09-15T08:12:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the vaccine. I feel it helps keep my family safer and keeps people out of the hospital.
43910,R3ID040369,2021-07-07T11:18:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve already gotten it and would get it again if a booster is needed
43915,R3ID040369,2021-10-13T09:11:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I got my Johnson and Johnson vaccine in April. I feel that it is very safe. I am willing to get as many vaccines as it takes to be healthy and protect my daughter.
43917,R3ID040369,2021-12-08T19:56:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I am remaining optimistic. I want to believe they?ll help. I?ve gotten my Johnson and Johnson vaccine and booster.
43921,R3ID040372,2021-09-16T20:08:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got vaccine
43923,R3ID040373,2021-07-07T09:44:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I still think it needs more research
43927,R3ID040373,2021-11-16T09:34:33Z,NA,NA,NA,On the fence
43932,R3ID040375,2021-11-10T16:10:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already gotten 2 doses of Moderna, and I plan to get the booster when I get my flu shot. I have been following several epidemiologists and public health professionals and I feel very safe taking any of the vaccines. When the vaccine becomes available for children under 5, my kid will be one of the first on the list."
43935,R3ID040376,2021-07-07T08:25:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it and feel confident in its safety
43937,R3ID040376,2021-11-10T10:29:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already received the full vaccine and a booster. I plan to get my daughter vaccinated as soon as it becomes available for her age group. I trust that likely side effects are minimal and that the long term risks are significantly less than the risks associated with having contracted COVID.
43939,R3ID040379,2021-07-07T08:55:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident in the vaccine and have already received it
43943,R3ID040380,2021-07-07T09:45:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it as a health are worker as soon as it was available. I think it?s safe and effective.
43946,R3ID040380,2021-11-10T09:12:47Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have received the full series plus booster. I feel it?s effective, but my first doses were while pregnant and I don?t know if my immune response at that time was as good as when not pregnant. No side effects."
43953,R3ID040383,2021-09-15T09:14:40Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have been vaccinated for Covid-19.  While I still contracted the virus, my experience of it was mild and I am high risk of complications due to asthma."
43957,R3ID040384,2021-07-07T13:19:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten it but I did not feel like it was pertinent to ending the pandemic and the United States nor necessary for my health. It is probably safe, but I just don't see the need and I do feel rather pressured into it rather than making the decision for myself and my family and having it be respected."
43958,R3ID040384,2021-09-15T11:19:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's probably safe and I and my spouse have personally gotten it but I will not be getting it from my children, As I feel that it is unnecessary based on the statistical data on children who are infected with covid and their symptoms"
43963,R3ID040386,2021-07-07T08:30:21Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm already vaccinated. I feel it's very safe.

43972,R3ID040389,2021-07-07T08:52:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"Currently nursing,  not planning on getting it until at least I?m done nursing or pumping"
43973,R3ID040389,2021-09-15T09:10:35Z,NA,NA,NA,Forced to get it- federal government. Would not have otherwise
43974,R3ID040389,2021-10-13T19:29:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Forced to get it because I work for the VA? would not have otherwise. My own antibodies are more efficient in fighting the virus.
43977,R3ID040390,2021-10-14T14:29:22Z,NA,NA,NA,"It is extremely safe and effective. My husband and I have already had 3 doses and received our first dose on the first day we were able. My children will be vaccinated as soon as possible. I am a nurse practitioner and very strongly recommend it to every patient I see. I am very passionate about all vaccines, but especially this one."
43986,R3ID040394,2021-12-09T10:01:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't agree with anything in terms to the COVID vaccine, especially: how quickly it was created, how little it was tested (we are the test subjects), how much it is pushed on people (here's some money to cooperate AKA bribery, which preys on the needs of struggling people), etc. My family and I will not be getting it, simple as that."
43995,R3ID040398,2021-07-07T08:47:33Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
44000,R3ID040399,2021-07-07T08:05:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Everyone must get it. When eligible (adults have) got it immediately and I tend the same for the children

44011,R3ID040402,2021-07-07T08:17:54Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I sis get it. We got it to protect our baby and Incase it was mandatory for our trip to Massachusetts
44018,R3ID040403,2021-09-16T01:27:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. But I feel as the vaccine is very polarizing. This whole situation has just been a mess. Their is distrust in the system and this system isn?t addressing that distrust.
44021,R3ID040403,2021-11-15T00:19:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it
44023,R3ID040403,2021-12-09T00:22:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. Benefits out weigh the risks.
44027,R3ID040407,2021-07-07T13:34:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it. I was worried about effectiveness and side effects
44031,R3ID040407,2021-09-15T13:53:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten my vaccine. But I know someone who has permanent side effects from it.
44033,R3ID040407,2021-11-13T13:16:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it. Need to research if I should get booster - Im in first trimester of pregnancy. Need to talk to my doctor.

44048,R3ID040415,2021-09-15T08:43:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it (while pregnant). I feel that it is completely safe and certainly better than getting Covid.
44049,R3ID040415,2021-10-13T09:48:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Great! I got it while pregnant
44050,R3ID040415,2021-11-10T09:04:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it has been thoroughly vetted and I feel safe taking it. I had my first and second shots while I was pregnant with my first child. I plan to get the booster soon.

44233,R3ID040507,2021-12-08T10:07:31Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m fully vaccinated and my immediate and extended family are also fully vaccinated. I don?t think this should be a political issue when the science is clear.

44240,R3ID040510,2021-11-12T09:06:55Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is incredibly safe and effective. I plan to get my booster shot ASAP. When my child is old enough, I will also have them vaccinated"

44306,R3ID040555,2021-07-08T11:38:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m confident in the vaccine and am vaccinated
44315,R3ID040562,2021-11-10T10:57:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good about the vaccine.  My spouse and I are vaccinated.  My two children just received their first dose of the vaccine this week.
44331,R3ID040575,2021-11-12T11:27:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"I've felt very confident in the COVID-19 vaccine. My husband and I were vaccinated early (I during pregnancy), and my husband got the booster already.  We've talked to our daughter about kids getting it and how she can next year."
44337,R3ID040579,2021-11-12T11:46:08Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten the vaccine and the booster.
44340,R3ID040581,2021-07-08T14:14:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I am uncertain and still undecided on my plan.
44344,R3ID040581,2021-09-15T10:49:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I am very nervous to get the vaccine. However I will be getting it once my 90 waiting period after having Covid is over.

44364,R3ID040591,2021-09-15T12:41:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten the vaccine. I got it as soon as it was available to me.
44366,R3ID040592,2021-07-08T10:00:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I trust science and have had the vaccine

44381,R3ID040596,2021-11-12T15:43:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like plenty of vaccines have been administered to ease my fear of serious side affects. I have no medical issues so I have no reason to believe that it will hurt me in any way. I have received my first dose: the only issues I had was a sore arm and was physically tired. My second dose is set for next Tuesday (Nov 16th).
44382,R3ID040596,2021-12-09T08:07:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I was hesitant to get it at first. After some time I finally got vaccined. I don?t like that people are being forced to get vaccinated though.
44433,R3ID040643,2021-09-15T12:42:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's completely safe and effective, but not as effective as it could be if more people got it. I got it right away, and my daughter will get it as soon as she is eligible."
44435,R3ID040643,2021-10-13T08:09:30Z,NA,NA,NA,Vaccines are safe and effective. I got it as soon as I could.
44436,R3ID040643,2021-11-10T09:14:47Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm confident it is safe and effective and have no concerns. I've gotten it and my child is already scheduled to get it.
44437,R3ID040643,2021-12-09T08:03:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am a strong proponent of vaccines and science. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective, and I got mine as soon as I could and I have scheduled my daughter for hers as well."
44443,R3ID040645,2021-12-08T17:25:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I am not vaccinated and did not even know I contracted covid until I was hospitalized for maternity issues and they did a routine check on me. I had no covid symptoms.
44445,R3ID040646,2021-11-12T18:07:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm fully vaccinated and will be getting my 5 year old vaccinated ASAP. Can't wait for my 2 year old to also be eligible for it
44450,R3ID040651,2021-11-13T10:30:23Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are fully vaccinated. Our kids are too young. I?m currently pregnant and will likely get a booster. I?m not sure how I feel giving it to my children should it be approved for kids under 5.
44454,R3ID040658,2021-11-11T22:02:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Eligible individuals have been vaccinated.  We are still unsure about the children.
44458,R3ID040660,2021-11-14T12:18:38Z,NA,NA,NA,All of the adults in my family have received the vaccine and the boosters. I feel very strongly that it is a good idea to get it.
44459,R3ID040660,2021-12-11T23:03:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that the covid vaccine is safe and effective and I have received it

44471,R3ID040665,2021-12-08T09:13:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received and had the booster. I think it remediates some risk and all who can safely receive should do so
44482,R3ID040671,2021-10-13T11:53:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Vaccinated
44483,R3ID040671,2021-12-08T13:40:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received it. Haven?t been diagnosed with covid. I did the spoon magnetic thing that was going around social media and WAS freaked out by feeling a magnetic pull about an hour after vaccination. After an hour it wore off. Thankfully that?s the only bad thing from it. Puts a little skepticism because it made bogus claims not so bogus.
44487,R3ID040674,2021-10-14T00:01:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it?s safe, already received the first dose"
44490,R3ID040675,2021-09-15T09:48:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was and still am unsure about it, but I have both moderna jabs."
44493,R3ID040676,2021-09-16T08:50:16Z,NA,NA,NA,It's safe and helps reduce severity. I got mine as soon I could.
44496,R3ID040681,2021-09-17T06:39:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in its' efficacy. I got it as soon as I could. Ive gotten 2 shots of Moderna.
44498,R3ID040681,2021-11-14T13:10:38Z,NA,NA,NA,It didn?t stop me from getting it. I had 2 shots of moderna. I suppose it may have helped me from having a worse case.
44500,R3ID040681,2021-12-08T19:08:32Z,NA,NA,NA,"I was fully vaccinated with Moderna but still got Covid so a part of me honestly is mad because I guess I had wished it would prevent me from getting it. For instance, the mumps vaccine - I?m vaccinated against that and I?ve never gotten the mumps. I get that people say that if I was never vaccinated it would?ve been worse for me but who is to say? I?m about to get the booster but is that going to protect me? Who knows."
44509,R3ID040686,2021-11-12T23:11:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure of it.?x not sure I?ll get booster
44512,R3ID040687,2021-11-10T13:51:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it is as safe as can be expected given the turn around time on production. Effectiveness remains to be seen but I have a feeling it'll turn into a seasonal flu shot type vaccine. I received the vaccine and am planning on getting the boosters. When it is available for my child's she group, I will be having him vaccinated as well. There are questions of long term risk but the risks of the global pandemic outweigh these in my mind."
44513,R3ID040687,2021-12-14T13:34:16Z,NA,NA,NA,"It's as safe as can be expected given it's timeline of production and the current crisis. I have received both doses and will be getting a booster. When it's approved for my child's she group, they will be getting it too."
44520,R3ID040691,2021-09-15T09:47:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is effective and safe. I'm pregnant and received the vaccine.
44521,R3ID040691,2021-12-08T10:28:43Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I have had the COVID-19 vaccine and we plan to get the booster shot soon. Hopefully we will get our older children vaccinated as well.
44524,R3ID040693,2021-09-16T09:01:34Z,NA,NA,NA,I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer in Feb/21. I work in healthcare so it was important that I get it. I hope it?s safe.
44533,R3ID040705,2021-09-16T12:37:08Z,NA,NA,NA,All of my family except my 2 year old is fully vaccinated. When it's available for the youngest he'll have it as well.
44547,R3ID040727,2021-10-13T08:56:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel good. It?s safe to get
44551,R3ID040728,2021-10-13T17:48:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it but waited until after my delivery because it wasn?t widely recommended for pregnant women at the time.
44556,R3ID040730,2021-11-10T10:15:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I want it but I am nervous about it and how it may effect my autoimmune diseases.
44571,R3ID040753,2021-10-13T10:57:36Z,NA,NA,NA,"I plan for my family yo get vaccinated when available however, i am scared that my children will have terrible side effects, specifically the inflamed  heart issues reported  in kids who received vaccination thus far."
44572,R3ID040753,2021-11-10T15:32:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am pro-vaccine. I received the two vaccines plus a booster. My child over five is scheduled to receive his vaccine in the next week, and I am anxiously awaiting vaccination for the baby."
44573,R3ID040753,2021-12-08T22:20:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been vaccinated and one of my kids has received the first dose as well.
44578,R3ID040755,2021-09-17T09:12:16Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel it?s safer than getting COVID. Have already received the vaccine.
44579,R3ID040755,2021-12-10T12:30:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already received. While I believe long term side effects from the vaccine are possible, I believe long term side effects from covid are much more likely. It's a calculated risk."
44600,R3ID040773,2021-12-10T10:36:56Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust it, and understand side effects/adverse reactions are a risk we take with any medication, vaccination, food, or drink. We are all vaccinated in my immediate family."
44603,R3ID040775,2021-11-14T10:03:25Z,NA,NA,NA,Already vaccinated. Still not sure about it?s safety but would rather be safe than sorry.
44607,R3ID040777,2021-12-14T14:02:03Z,NA,NA,NA,Me and my oldest child along with my fiancé just got our first vaccine because we want to be on the safe side in case we were to catch Covid
44617,R3ID040786,2021-09-15T16:41:02Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am strongly considering getting the vaccine because things are getting worse. I'm waoting on results for someone i live with. I'm not sure how effective it will be but right now I'm thinking ""what could it hurt?"""
44618,R3ID040786,2021-10-14T08:09:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure if it is worth getting
44620,R3ID040786,2021-11-10T10:36:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure how I feel. I'm a little closer to getting the vaccine but not 100% sure.
44622,R3ID040786,2021-12-10T19:44:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Not sure how safe or effective it is. How do we know that it ensures that a person won't get covid as bad if we don't know how it will affect them anyway?
44636,R3ID040796,2021-11-15T14:45:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe and will allow the world to her back to some sort of normalcy
44637,R3ID040796,2021-12-08T10:02:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it does what most vaccines do. Vaccines are not cures but they do help to ease the symptoms and lower chances of death.
44640,R3ID040798,2021-10-13T14:31:00Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m vaccinated, but managed to get COVID-19 however after 10days it was over. So have mixture feelings, vaccine did not protect me 100% but I did not die."
44649,R3ID040800,2021-09-16T08:31:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten the vaccine.  I am hopeful that it will help control the number of cases
44651,R3ID040800,2021-10-13T09:35:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it.  I think it is helpful
44653,R3ID040800,2021-11-12T15:25:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it is the best chance we currently have of getting this pandemic under control. I hope there won't be any overly harmful long term side effects.  I have been vaccinated.
44655,R3ID040800,2021-12-08T13:19:31Z,NA,NA,NA,The vaccine provides a good chance of getting things back on track.  I have already gotten the vaccine
44657,R3ID040801,2021-11-10T12:05:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel GREAT about it! I had my 3rd dose (because of a health condition); got my 8yo his 1st dose yesterday. Will get my youngest vaccinated as soon as he is eligible.
44664,R3ID040805,2021-12-10T18:29:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve got it and I?m ready for my son who?s 5 to get it
44669,R3ID040807,2021-09-16T09:05:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Undetermined but should be a choice
44670,R3ID040807,2021-12-09T18:29:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not 100%  fan of it but I have no choice but to take it and think it should be a choice and not mandatory.
44681,R3ID040815,2021-10-13T14:13:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have gotten my COVID-19 vaccine. I waited a little while before receiving my first dose to see how it panned out with the rest of the population. I started my series in April and finished it in May. I didn't have a specific concern that lead to my wait, I just wanted to see how others did with it first."
44683,R3ID040815,2021-11-10T09:41:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it in one of the first months it was available. I let a little time pass between those first few doses in the US and when I actually got mine. I had faith everything would go right but these months confirmed that the vaccines was safe. I am happy with its effectiveness but I have heard of people who are not happy with it.
44685,R3ID040815,2021-12-10T09:47:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it?s safe
44688,R3ID040818,2021-09-16T08:30:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident in the safety and effectiveness and I am fully vaccinated.
44706,R3ID040835,2021-11-15T15:29:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in its efficacy and already got the first 2 doses + the booster
44711,R3ID040836,2021-09-15T20:30:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it's like any other vaccine.
44723,R3ID040840,2021-12-14T13:07:15Z,NA,NA,NA,It?s great and I desperately want my 4yo to be able to be vaccinated like the rest of the family is!
44741,R3ID040853,2021-09-15T09:37:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to wait a while longer to see if there are more side effects. I?m pretty nervous about it
44745,R3ID040853,2021-12-12T09:05:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m hesitant on the vaccine. We?re don?t know all the side affects. I?ve actually seen more people die from the reaction of the vaccine than Covid. I question whether it?s truly safe. It?s being pushed so hard & fast. I feel like the government is trying to take our basic rights and choices. I?m not big on getting it.
44751,R3ID040858,2021-10-13T12:10:21Z,NA,NA,NA,Not get it.
44754,R3ID040859,2021-10-16T23:18:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the pfizer vaccine and I felt pretty good about getting it although I think there are too many vaccines being given to our children in general.  After reading more about some of the adverse effects some people are getting I am wondering if there needs to be more research done.  Espeically when it comes to vaccinating children I do not feel comfortable vaccinating them for covid yet.
44757,R3ID040860,2021-10-13T08:21:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine and so did my family
44761,R3ID040862,2021-12-12T08:10:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I wish it were more effective but I?m thankful for it.
44774,R3ID040871,2021-12-08T09:12:23Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s very safe. We are both boosted and our son will get the shot when it?s available. Unfortunately his pediatrician is saying we should wait for more data
44777,R3ID040872,2021-10-13T08:04:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated and eligible for the booster. I will get the booster as soon as I have a chance. I know the vaccine is safe and effective and our best chance of keeping people alive and well.
44783,R3ID040874,2021-09-15T09:43:50Z,NA,NA,NA,"Safe, but hesitant because of lack of studies and long term effects"
44785,R3ID040874,2021-10-13T10:32:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Hesitant due to lack of info on long-term effects
44787,R3ID040874,2021-11-10T09:24:53Z,NA,NA,NA,"Believe it?s effective and safe especially to immunocompromised individuals, but still hesitant to get because of lack of information regarding long-term effects and because of natural immunity resulting from positive cases. If body can fight it itself and gain immunity, why force the vaccine on such individuals?"
44789,R3ID040874,2021-12-08T08:59:10Z,NA,NA,NA,Believe in effectiveness but hesitant to get because of media/ govt pressure
44795,R3ID040877,2021-10-14T20:40:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan for more studies to be done
44799,R3ID040880,2021-10-13T09:53:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received my vaccination.
44800,R3ID040880,2021-11-12T09:33:00Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received both of my vaccinations. My 5 year old will be getting his first shot tomorrow. He has gotten covid twice and we have a newborn at home. We believe the vaccine is safe and helpful to reduce Covid.
44805,R3ID040883,2021-10-16T08:23:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated
44809,R3ID040884,2021-12-11T10:53:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"Already got it (and booster), I trust scientists and researchers to know much more about the process, vaccines, and the virus than anyone else. I think it is our best line of defense."
44818,R3ID040888,2021-10-14T08:55:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think it is effective & I don't disagree or agree with ppl on getting the vaccine that is their right
44820,R3ID040888,2021-11-14T15:40:44Z,NA,NA,NA,"I don't think they have done enough research, it takes years to study a new virus and make a vaccine for it. I'm not getting it."
44822,R3ID040888,2021-12-09T11:16:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not think they have done enough research on it b/c it takes years not months to come up with effective medicine. I do not plan on getting it until the trial run is over.
44826,R3ID040893,2021-12-08T16:55:53Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think it should be forced. Everyone that has had it says it's just like the flu.
44838,R3ID040901,2021-12-08T08:25:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm all for it. I've already gotten my booster. My 5 year old got the vaccine as soon as it was available and he is fully vaccinated. I believe in science. I defer to the experts.
44841,R3ID040903,2021-09-15T15:47:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe
44844,R3ID040904,2021-09-16T18:48:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it and would have been the first in line if I'd been allowed.

44855,R3ID040911,2021-10-17T01:20:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Not effective. Don't want to get it
44858,R3ID040912,2021-09-16T08:08:33Z,NA,NA,NA,I got the vaccine as soon as I was able. Historically vaccines have eradicated or slowed down the spread of viruses. I feel it is safe and real life results show it is effective.
44929,R3ID040980,2021-10-13T09:28:00Z,NA,NA,NA,Have already
44930,R3ID040980,2021-11-10T10:13:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Already have mine
44938,R3ID040986,2021-09-16T09:11:20Z,NA,NA,NA,Will not get it.  Feel like it is not safe
44948,R3ID040988,2021-11-10T09:54:42Z,NA,NA,NA,"I will not get it. You can still get COVID with it, so why? 

Also it has had side effects for some. I don't trust it and they shouldn't be mandating it"
44951,R3ID040990,2021-11-12T16:44:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel it's safe and effective. Working in health-care, I have seen the decrease in severity of disease among vaccinated individuals. It may not prevent COVID all together, but it is helpful.
I am currently vaccinated and plan to get my children vaccinated as soon as they reach the minimum age of the vaccine is approved for younger ages."
44955,R3ID040992,2021-11-10T10:03:48Z,NA,NA,NA,"I fully support the Covid-19 vaccines and wish that everyone would get them. I have been fully vaccinated since April 2021 and will get my booster as soon as I?m eligible. My husband and I are also eager to get our baby vaccinated. We have done a substantial amount of research and have consulted with our healthcare providers and feel that it is safe to vaccinate our baby. The one caveat that I would like to mention is that there is not enough being done for individuals who have suffered adverse reactions from the vaccine. My dad developed severe tinnitus, hearing loss, memory loss, and brain fog within 20 minutes of his first dose of Pfizer. 8 months and dozens of specialists later, he hasn?t shown any improvement. There is a whole community of thousands of people who are suffering from the same side effects and they are not being supported or taken seriously. It is heartbreaking. My dad aged 20 years overnight. He is not the same person anymore. All that being said, I still believe that the Covid vaccines are better than the alternative of allowing a raging pandemic to continue."
44965,R3ID040998,2021-09-15T12:41:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it. Idk how effective it will be but hopefully it slows the spread.
44967,R3ID040998,2021-10-14T10:32:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it. I wish it was approved for children though.

44982,R3ID041007,2021-09-16T20:32:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe and effective and got it as soon as I could

45030,R3ID041053,2021-11-10T11:08:54Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve received 3 covid vaccines thus far. I feel strongly that everyone should get vaccinated.

45039,R3ID041061,2021-12-10T08:47:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s very safe and everyone eligible has gotten it in our household including boosters
45047,R3ID041065,2021-09-15T10:49:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t plan on getting the vaccine at this time. I would like to wait and see what the long term effects are going to be.
45048,R3ID041065,2021-10-13T08:30:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m still undecided on getting the vaccine, but leaning more towards not getting it because I think that?s the best option for my household."
45050,R3ID041065,2021-11-11T10:10:13Z,NA,NA,NA,My family and I still have not gotten the vaccine and as of right now we do not plan to get it anytime soon.

I believe in vaccines and their helpfulness in eradicating illnesses; however, the number of breakthrough cases (people I know personally) is slightly disheartening. However, they did not get as sick as they may have if they had not been vaccinated."

45094,R3ID041088,2021-11-10T14:14:45Z,NA,NA,NA,Very safe. Got the shot as soon as I was eligible and I plan for my children to get it as soon as they are eligible
45095,R3ID041088,2021-12-08T08:33:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"Very safe. Amazing feat from the medical community. I got the vaccine as soon as it was available to me, and my children will get it as soon as it is available to them"

45116,R3ID041105,2021-10-14T08:57:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan on getting it but wanted to see the after effects first to decide which one to get
45120,R3ID041111,2021-10-13T10:33:17Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I figure it's safe enough for me.
45135,R3ID041121,2021-11-12T11:30:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it only because I had to for work. I still think there needs to be more research on it.

45143,R3ID041125,2021-11-15T15:22:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"This family absolutely will not take the risk of a vaccine that?s barely tested. I don?t believe it?s effective enough versus the risk a vaccine imposes. A vaccine is a live sample of the actual disease just tamed and weakened for building antibodies. I don?t believe the virus, if as serious as the media has shown it, that it can BE tamed and put into a SAFE vaccine."
45145,R3ID041126,2021-10-14T08:39:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I am vaccinated

45153,R3ID041131,2021-10-16T17:49:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I?ve been vaccinated I think it is mostly effective
45161,R3ID041137,2021-10-16T11:20:35Z,NA,NA,NA,I am a bit uneasy of the long term effects.  I plan to get it once they are all fully approved for all ages.  I am a breastfeeding mom and just want to be extra sure it?s safe.  I?m still taking as many precautions as possible though
45164,R3ID041138,2021-10-14T09:37:34Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
45165,R3ID041138,2021-11-11T03:57:36Z,NA,NA,NA,Definitely effective. Already got it.
45167,R3ID041138,2021-12-13T19:50:07Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got it
45173,R3ID041143,2021-11-10T10:22:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it can help lessen the chance of getting COVID-19 and help reduce the length and severity that someone is sick.  I am currently vaccinated and considering a booster.
45178,R3ID041146,2021-09-16T13:59:42Z,NA,NA,NA,Good I got vaccinated
45182,R3ID041149,2021-11-10T10:45:59Z,NA,NA,NA,Feel very good. My 8yo child got it 2 days after approval and we are anxious for 3yo to get it. Parents fully vaxxed.

45195,R3ID041158,2021-09-15T12:19:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe and effective. I plan on getting a booster if recommend
45196,R3ID041158,2021-10-13T08:21:51Z,NA,NA,NA,I am all for the vaccine. I just received shot #3.
45198,R3ID041158,2021-11-10T14:02:51Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe in them 100%. Just like the flu shot, they are not guaranteed to keep you from getting sick, but they certainly reduce your chances of a serious or life threatening illness."
45205,R3ID041162,2021-12-14T18:48:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think enough research has been conducted so I will not get it

45216,R3ID041170,2021-12-08T11:03:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is safe and effective for the most part but I worry about how it could affect breastfeeding and I don't want to take that risk. I believe there are side effects that the science community leadership doesn't want to discuss because they don't want people to panic but I believe things need to be more transparent
45219,R3ID041171,2021-09-16T01:42:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I really want to get vaccinated, and I've been looking for a chance to think how do I get vaccinated"

45241,R3ID041176,2021-11-15T14:39:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I think the vaccine went through the trials much too quickly.  I do not plan on getting it

45259,R3ID041187,2021-09-15T12:26:55Z,NA,NA,NA,Very effective. I got it already
45260,R3ID041187,2021-10-14T09:03:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it - it?s safe

45272,R3ID041193,2021-11-10T09:09:46Z,NA,NA,NA,"As of now I will not get it. You can still get it, still spread it, still be hospitalized, and still die. I know with all vaccines this can still happen but  I haven't seen anything proven that we are told it is. I know more people who have been sick from it and fully vaccinated than are not."
45275,R3ID041195,2021-10-13T10:49:41Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not feel like it?s safe enough to get at this time and I do not have any plans on getting it.
45277,R3ID041196,2021-09-16T08:32:10Z,NA,NA,NA,I dont get ANY vaccine unless it has been available for years. So no covid vaccine for years for me

45287,R3ID041200,2021-12-08T08:44:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it but I also think it's everyone's individual Choice whether they get it or not

I don?t trust the word of the government and haven?t seen enough testing to trust the safety of the vaccine. My husband, son, and I all had Covid and faired just fine.

45676,R3ID041429,2021-11-13T13:23:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I have concerns with its potential impact on my fertility. I personally did not plan to get the vaccine but my 17 month old has been hospitalized twice with respiratory distress rhino enterovirus and required extensive supportive care with non invasive positive pressure vent. I think any potential to reduce his exposure risk with me getting vaccinated out weighs the potential risks to me so I am getting the vaccine to help reduce potential severe hospitalization and complications for my child.
45692,R3ID041441,2021-10-13T16:06:53Z,NA,NA,NA,i am too skeptical to get it

45696,R3ID041441,2021-12-08T17:44:26Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't trust it nor do I plan on getting it.
45699,R3ID041442,2021-10-16T09:17:20Z,NA,NA,NA,I am forced to get it. If I want to keep my job.
45701,R3ID041442,2021-11-14T01:58:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I am half way vaccinated. I need to get my second shot. I wasn?t too big on the shot at first but I got it to protect myself and others around me.
45709,R3ID041447,2021-10-13T11:46:18Z,NA,NA,NA,i feel positive and have gotten 2 plus the booster at this point
45710,R3ID041447,2021-11-10T09:50:04Z,NA,NA,NA,"i am triple vaccinated and everyone in my immediate family is as well, except for my child who is 3, i want them to approve the vaccine for her as well."

45722,R3ID041451,2021-12-10T08:10:17Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe it?s effective, I?m vaccinated."
45734,R3ID041460,2021-10-17T11:33:05Z,NA,NA,NA,"I trust it works. I have been vaccinated since my baby's birth, and willget the booster when needed"
45750,R3ID041471,2021-10-16T14:24:29Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vsccinr is safe and effective enough to be fully vaccinated and to get my child vaccinated once able.
45756,R3ID041475,2021-10-13T10:39:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan on getting it soon. I had to wait awhile for the kinks. But we had Covid vaccine breastmilk
45757,R3ID041475,2021-11-10T09:27:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe after the year the vaccine is safe. I plan on getting it soon since I will be returning to a building.
45759,R3ID041476,2021-11-13T02:59:52Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel the slightest bit of uncertainty considering the long term effects of the vaccine are impossible to know at the moment. I am fully vaccinated though. I trust science, and I know a lot of research has gone into the vaccine development."
45773,R3ID041495,2021-11-10T11:28:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is safe. I received both doses while pregnant and my 6 year old will receive her first dose this weekend
45777,R3ID041498,2021-10-13T10:39:45Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it and so has my spouse. We believe it is safe and effective in preventing serious illness.
45781,R3ID041499,2021-12-08T10:33:04Z,NA,NA,NA,At this point I?d rather have any ?negative? results than Covid-19. I have been fully vaccinated for 6 months and intend to get a booster later this month.
45783,R3ID041500,2021-10-14T08:45:36Z,NA,NA,NA,I have it I won?t vaccinate my daughter tho.
45784,R3ID041500,2021-12-08T11:12:24Z,NA,NA,NA,"Me and my husband are both vaccinated now, but my daughter won?t be even when she becomes eligible due to not enough info."
45792,R3ID041507,2021-11-15T15:21:43Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I got the COVID-19 vaccine. It gave me a sense of relief getting it since it is so unknown how COVID is going to affect each individual. My son is 4 years old and I am still apprehensive about getting the vaccine for him when it does become available for his age group just because it is new and the COVID risk for small children is not as great as older adults.
45793,R3ID041507,2021-12-08T14:23:13Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I received the vaccine. It seems effective at preventing severe illness. I am still a little up in the air about the safety of it and will probably delay vaccinating our son just to see how it goes for other kids.
45796,R3ID041509,2021-10-14T15:44:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is safe and effective and I have been vaccinated. I don't plan to get a booster however, since I do not consider myself a high risk individual."
45799,R3ID041510,2021-11-12T10:12:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I have already gotten it.
45800,R3ID041510,2021-12-08T09:54:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Not worth it
45802,R3ID041511,2021-10-13T09:01:42Z,NA,NA,NA,safe and effective. Got it as soon as possible. Got booster due to immunocompromised state
45810,R3ID041517,2021-11-12T09:07:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe in it and received the moderna vaccine in my second trimester of pregnancy
45813,R3ID041519,2021-10-14T11:33:47Z,NA,NA,NA,pro-vaccine
45816,R3ID041521,2021-10-13T11:13:40Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the COVID-19 vaccine and feel it is an important aspect in keeping our community safe. I am currently pregnant and will choose to get the booster if is recommended that I get it.
45823,R3ID041525,2021-10-13T09:39:15Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not confident that the vaccine is effective or safe at the moment. I do not plan on getting it at this time.
45824,R3ID041525,2021-11-10T12:41:01Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't feel that we know enough about long term. I do not feel comfortable getting it at this time.
45835,R3ID041533,2021-12-08T10:11:36Z,NA,NA,NA,i will not be getting the vaccine. i dont feel it is safe nor effective.
45838,R3ID041535,2021-10-13T08:40:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I recommend it
45877,R3ID041569,2021-11-12T09:07:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it is safe option to help prevent people from getting covid. It is an important part of helping to fight covid and the pandemic
45879,R3ID041569,2021-12-10T08:08:13Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is a great start to helping prevent the further spread of the virus. I think it is a vital part of overcoming such a great loss.
45884,R3ID041573,2021-12-14T22:15:06Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received both vaccinations due to work but was hesitant. I am debating over the booster
45888,R3ID041575,2021-12-13T07:19:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I already got it. I was hesitant because of the length of time it?s been in the market but also wanted to weigh out all options. Pros and cons.
45900,R3ID041585,2021-11-10T14:09:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"Get it! Run, don't walk, go get vaccinated!!!"
45901,R3ID041585,2021-12-08T13:19:19Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel very confident in the vaccine. Our whole family is vaccinated, including our daughter who got her second shot this week."
45925,R3ID041607,2021-12-08T23:18:16Z,NA,NA,NA,I think vaccines are safe and effective. I have been vaccinated.
45935,R3ID041613,2021-12-08T23:18:09Z,NA,NA,NA,I think vaccines are safe and reliable.
45959,R3ID041633,2021-11-11T16:16:43Z,NA,NA,NA,It's to new and I don't trust it so I won't be getting it
46004,R3ID041666,2021-11-14T10:26:09Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?ve gotten the vaccine but I honestly don?t know how effective it is. I got it so I could keep those around me safe, but after the fact I learned that I could still catch covid and be a carrier. So what was the point? I think the safety aspect isn?t something to be too concerned about for myself, but I don?t yet know if I?ll have my children vaccinated."
46013,R3ID041671,2021-12-08T10:12:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel that it is effective and safe and everyone should get it that is able. Myself and qualifying members of my family have received our vaccinations. And will be getting our boosters as well.
46018,R3ID041675,2021-11-14T17:52:43Z,NA,NA,NA,I received the vaccine several months ago. I believe it's safe for people who do not have a history of having reactions to vaccines. I am more hesitant for the under 12 age group based on lack of information and potential long term side effects.
46019,R3ID041675,2021-12-14T10:29:25Z,NA,NA,NA,I am fully vaccinated. It seems effective against hospitalization and severe illness so far.
46030,R3ID041683,2021-12-08T09:33:24Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel there is not enough info on long term effects
46040,R3ID041689,2021-11-14T19:23:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I?m supportive of the vaccine and can?t wait for my son to get it
46048,R3ID041694,2021-12-10T08:53:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine hasn?t had the time to be tested and worked on to cover a Virus that hit us not too long ago . To come with a feasible vaccination, its proven that scientists need at least 3 years; which is why now people that have been vaccinated now need ?boosters? . What are in these ?boosters? ?? :. 
My entire family has been vaccinated, which is why i decided to go get it myself , however at the doctors office I was told that the vaccine hasn?t been tested for side effects in pregnant women or in family planning. We are currently trying to have another baby. This got me concerned so I leaned to NOT get vaccinated."
46052,R3ID041696,2021-11-12T15:00:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure if I should trust it given the amount of time it's been out. I don't know the long term effects.
46071,R3ID041713,2021-11-10T22:17:25Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think it's as safe as it can be and a better alternative than catching COVID. All eligible family members have had the vaccine, and my 10-yr-old just got her first dose."
46073,R3ID041713,2021-12-08T13:09:13Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm glad it seems to be working as intended, and everyone in my family who is eligible has had the vaccine and the booster."
46085,R3ID041724,2021-11-12T11:01:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I am very unsure of its safety and effectiveness as I know people that are vaccinated and ended up in the hospital or dead. I plan on avoiding the vaccine as long as I can
46086,R3ID041724,2021-12-08T10:28:33Z,NA,NA,NA,"i believe it may be effective to some extent, but I am not sure of the safety and 100% effectiveness"
46088,R3ID041725,2021-11-15T15:03:32Z,NA,NA,NA,I do not believe there has been enough time to detect if it is safe or not especially for kids. I currently am not going to take it and will decide later on.
46090,R3ID041726,2021-11-12T15:39:28Z,NA,NA,NA,I already have the vaccine and plan to get the booster
46092,R3ID041727,2021-11-12T09:12:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I have been fully vaccinated since January 2021 - was very relieved to get it. I will be getting my booster today. I feel strongly in the need for people to get vaccinated as it is proven effective and safe.
46105,R3ID041738,2021-11-10T10:04:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already gotten it but will wait for my kids. It was rushed so there's a possibility it's not 100% safe
46108,R3ID041739,2021-11-12T09:14:07Z,NA,NA,NA,"I?m nervous about efficacy and long term side effects on my children, benefit outweighs potential risk and we all are vaccinated or in the process of completely vaccination (for those of us who qualify)."
46131,R3ID041758,2021-11-15T15:07:42Z,NA,NA,NA,I not afraid of the vaccine.
46154,R3ID041778,2021-12-08T09:00:44Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t trust it. I don?t trust any vaccines after research and personal experience. I will not get vaccinated or vaccinate my children anymore.
46160,R3ID041783,2021-11-15T16:31:02Z,NA,NA,NA,I very much support the vaccine. All eligible family members have been vaccinated. I have been vaccinated and received my booster. I am anxiously awaiting for children under age 5 to be eligible for the vaccine.
46172,R3ID041793,2021-12-08T10:09:28Z,NA,NA,NA,"I am fully vaccinated as well as my husband. As soon as it was available for children, I vaccinated my 5 and 8 year old daughters too."
46174,R3ID041794,2021-12-08T09:03:01Z,NA,NA,NA,"Everyone in my family 5 and up is being vaccinated. It makes me a bit nervous as there are always risks, but also gives me peace of mind."
46190,R3ID041806,2021-12-09T11:24:27Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the public were told it was going to stop us from getting or spreading Covid-19, however we know now that that is not the case. I am vaccinated and received a booster and have not gotten Covid as of yet. I am very pro-vaccines, but do feel that we are not getting all of the information about the covid vaccines"

46248,R3ID041859,2021-12-14T12:37:57Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten it as well as my children. I?m still a little skeptical but I need to protect myself and my kids.
46259,R3ID041869,2021-12-08T09:26:54Z,NA,NA,NA,Good
46264,R3ID041873,2021-12-08T09:05:58Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the vaccine and will get it for my child whoeb it's available
46278,R3ID041886,2021-12-10T11:10:59Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel the vaccine may be safe to use however I do not see the need to get it. I prefer to build natural immunity

46316,R3ID041921,2021-12-09T15:48:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe it is effective and I have received the vaccine so has my husband and we will get the booster and my son (8) has received both doses of the vaccine. Having a vaccine gives me some relief and hope that we can visit more family. We still wear masks but the vaccine mitigates symptoms and reduces risk

46330,R3ID041933,2021-12-08T11:59:10Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel that the vaccine should have never been made mandatory for many reasons. It has not been tested long enough to assess long-term side effects on recipients. It also is not effective against the many covid variants that are constantly announced every few weeks. Side-effects are being ignored by mass media which makes the integrity of the vaccine look bad to me personally. I also do not like sharing my private health information in order to eat at restaurants, shop or just live life. It's tyrranical and a slippery slope towards authoritariansm."
46349,R3ID041951,2021-12-12T08:06:56Z,NA,NA,NA,I have gotten the vaccine
