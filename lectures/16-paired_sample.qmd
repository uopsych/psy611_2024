------------------------------------------------------------------------

In **longitudinal research**, the same people provide responses to the same measure on two occasions (the individuals in the two groups are the same).

In **paired-sample research**, the individuals in the two groups are different, but they are related and their responses are assumed to be correlated. Examples would be responses by children and their parents, members of couples, twins, etc.

In **paired-measures research**, the same people provide responses to two different measures that assess closely related constructs. This resembles longitudinal research, but data collection occurs at one time.

All of these are instances of repeated measures designs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The advantage of repeated measures designs is that, compared to an independent groups design of the same size, the repeated measures design is **more powerful**.

-   Two groups are more alike than in simple randomization

-   The correlated sampling units will have less variability on "nuisance variables" because those are either the same over time (longitudinal) or over measures (paired measures), or very similar over people (paired samples).

-   Nuisance variables -- anything that isn't relevant to the study.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of these repeated measures problems can be viewed as a transformation of the original two measures into a single measure: a difference score. This reduces the analysis to a one-sample *t*-test on the difference score, with null mean = 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the repeated measures are $X_1$ and $X_2$, then their difference is $D = X_1 – X_2$. This new measure has a mean and standard deviation, like any other single measure, making it appropriate for a one-sample *t*-test.

$$t_{df = N-1} = \frac{\bar{\Delta}-\mu}{\frac{\hat{\sigma}_\Delta}{\sqrt{N}}}$$

## Example 1: Gulls

Human-wildlife conflict in urban areas endangers wildlife species. One species under threat is the *Larus argentatus* or herring gull, which is considered a nuisance owing to food-snatching and other behaviors. A [recent study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0405) examined whether herring gull behavior is influenced by human behavior cues and whether this could be used to reduce human-gull conflict.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hypothesis testing

Use a paired-samples *t*-test because we have the same gulls in both conditions.

$\large H_0$: There is no difference in how long it takes gulls to approach food between conditions.

$\large H_1$: Gulls take longer to approach food in one of the conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sampling distribution

*t*-distribution requires two parameters, a mean and a standard deviation.

The mean of our sampling distribution comes from our null hypothesis, so

$$\large \mu = 0$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sampling distribution

Our standard deviation of our sampling distribution is the **standard error of difference scores**. This is calculated via the following steps

1.  calculating difference scores $(X_{1i}-X_{2i} = D_i)$
2.  calculating the standard deviation of the difference scores $(s_D = \hat{\sigma}_D)$, and
3.  dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of *pairs* in your study $(se_D = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_D}{\sqrt{N}})$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo = 1}
(difference = gulls$At - gulls$Away)
```

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
We can take the mean of this new variable:

```{r, echo = 1}
(m_delta = mean(difference))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
And we can calculate the standard deviation

```{r, echo = 1}
(s_delta = sd(difference))
```
:::
:::::

To calculate the standard error of difference scores, we simply divide the standard deviation by the square root of the number of *pairs* or, if repeated measures, the number of *subjects*.

```{r}
(se_delta = s_delta/sqrt(nrow(gulls)))
```

$$\frac{\hat{\sigma}_\Delta}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{`r round(s_delta,2)`}{\sqrt{`r nrow(gulls)`}} = `r round(se_delta, 2)`$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

df = nrow(gulls)-1
cv_t = qt(df = df, p = .975)
t_x = seq(-3.76, 3.76)
plot_t = data.frame(t_x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=t_x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "line") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(cv_t, 3.76), fill = "purple") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(-3.76, -1*cv_t), fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution \n(in t)", y = "density", x = "t")+
  theme_pubr(base_size = 20)

cv_x = cv_t*se_delta 
x = t_x*se_delta
plot_x = data.frame(x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x = x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "line") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(cv_x, max(x)), fill = "purple") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(min(x), -1*cv_x), fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution \n(in difference in seconds)", y = "density", x = "difference seconds")+
  theme_pubr(base_size = 20)

ggarrange(plot_t, plot_x, ncol = 2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Test statistic

$$t_{df = N-1} = \frac{\bar{\Delta}-\mu}{\frac{\hat{\sigma}_\Delta}{\sqrt{N}}}$$

In this case, N refers to the number of pairs, not the total sample size.

$$t_{df = N-1} = \frac{`r round(m_delta,2)`-0}{`r round(se_delta,2)`} = `r round(m_delta/se_delta,2)`$$

**Note:** A paired-samples *t*-test is *exactly* the same as a one-sample *t*-test on the difference scores.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| 
df = nrow(gulls)-1
cv_t = qt(df = df, p = .975)
t_x = seq(-3.76, 3.76)
statistic_t = m_delta/se_delta
plot_t = data.frame(t_x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=t_x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "line") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "area",

                xlim = c(-3.76, -1*cv_t), fill = "purple") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = statistic_t), linetype = 2, color = "red")+
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution \n(in t)", y = "density", x = "t")+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-3.8, 3.8))+
  theme_pubr(base_size = 20)

cv_x = cv_t*se_delta 
x = t_x*se_delta
statistic_x = statistic_t*se_delta
plot_x = data.frame(x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x = x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "line") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(cv_x, max(x)), fill = "purple") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x/se_delta, df = df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(min(x), -1*cv_x), fill = "purple") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = statistic_x), linetype = 2, color = "red")+
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution \n(in difference in seconds)", y = "density", x = "difference seconds")+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-3.8*se_delta, 3.8*se_delta))+
  theme_pubr(base_size = 20)

ggarrange(plot_t, plot_x, ncol = 2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another option is to calculate the area above the absolute value of the test statistic and multiply that by two -- this estimates the probability of finding this test statistic or more extreme.

```{r}
(t_statistic = m_delta/se_delta)
pt(t_statistic, df = 19-1, lower.tail = F)
pt(t_statistic, df = 19-1, lower.tail = F)*2
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## t-test functions

```{r, highlight=3}
t.test(x = gulls$At, 
       y = gulls$Away, 
       paired = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## t-test functions

```{r, highlight=3}
lsr::pairedSamplesTTest(formula = ~Away + At, data = gulls)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 2: Larks and Owls

People differ in their optimal time of day to perform a task (morning people = larks, evening people = owls). [One study tested whether mind-wandering was more likely at one time of day](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/57536/195006/Mind-wandering-in-Larks-and-Owls-The-Effects-of) and as a function of chronotype. Participants completed an attention task twice: once in the morning and once in the evening.

For this example, we'll be ignoring individual differences (weep) and focus only on the mind-wandering task variable. 

```{r}
lao = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy611/refs/heads/master/data/Larks%20and%20Owls.csv")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
lao %>% select(Subject, TimeOfDay, MWCount) %>% head()
lsr::pairedSamplesTTest(formula = MWCount~TimeOfDay, data = lao, id = "Subject")
```

## Visualizing paired-samples t-test

There's a choice between displaying the statistics being tested (the mean and standard error of the difference scores) and displaying the data in its original units (two points per subject, means of individual conditions). You can't have both. Pick the one that best conveys the information you want a reader to walk away with. 

Better yet, put one in your manuscript and the other in supplemental material!

Also, making good data visualizations can take some work. But it's really worth it. This is where AI can be a great friend!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The variance of difference scores

With the raw data, the calculation of the variance of the standard deviation scores $\large (\hat{\sigma}_\Delta)$ is intuitive. Sometimes you will not have access to the raw data, but will want to conduct the test.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, you read a study that compares a sample of Oregon students to known US benchmarks on several variables using multiple one-sample *t*-tests; you want to know whether OR students respond more to one variable than the other.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
#| code-fold: true
school = read_csv(here("data/census_at_school.csv"))
school = school %>% filter(ClassGrade >= 9) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Importance_reducing_pollution)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Importance_recycling_rubbish)) 
psych::describe(school[,c("Importance_reducing_pollution", "Importance_recycling_rubbish")], fast = T) %>%
  select(n, mean, sd) %>%
  kable(., col.names = c("N", "Mean", "SD"),
        digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()

cor_12 = cor(school$Importance_reducing_pollution, 
             school$Importance_recycling_rubbish, 
             use = "pairwise")

```

The correlation between these variables is `r round(cor_12, digits = 2)`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It turns out that the mean difference score is the same as the difference in means, so that's an easy part of the calculation.

But the calculation of the standard deviation becomes a little more complicated:

$$\large \hat{\sigma}_\Delta = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2_{X_1} + \hat{\sigma}^2_{X_2} - 2r(\hat{\sigma}_{X_1}\hat{\sigma}_{X_2})}$$

```{r}
sd_1 = 937.03
sd_2 = 652.65
cor_12 = .61
var_d = sd_1^2 + sd_2^2 -2*cor_12*sd_1*sd_2
sqrt(var_d)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you have all the information you need for the statistical test!

```{r}
(t = (792.15-714.85)/(746.92/sqrt(194)))

pt(t, df = 193, lower.tail = F)*2
```

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=4, fig.width = 10}
df =193
cv_t = qt(df = df, p = .975)
t_x = seq(-3.76, 3.76)
data.frame(t_x) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=t_x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "line") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(cv_t, 3.76), fill = "purple") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(-3.76, -1*cv_t), fill = "purple") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = t), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution \n(in t)", y = "density", x = "t")+
  theme_pubr(base_size = 20)
```

Useful for meta-analysis or getting more information from articles you read.

What else can this equation tell us?

What happens if the two variables are highly correlated with each other?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\large \hat{\sigma}_\Delta = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2_{X_1} + \hat{\sigma}^2_{X_2} - 2r(\hat{\sigma}_{X_1}\hat{\sigma}_{X_2})}$$

-   What happens if $\large r$ is large and positive?

-   What happens if $\large r$ is small and positive?

-   What happens if $\large r$ is negative?

::: notes
large and postive: se is very small small and positive: se is smaller but not so much negative: se is bigger

take away: likely to find differences when two measures are positively associated, but hurt if negatively may consider reverse scoring measures...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assumptions

-   Independence (between pairs)
-   Normality

**Note:** These are the same assumptions as a one-sample *t*-test.
