# Threats to validity
## AKA Research methods in 90 minutes

---

class: inverse

## Reminders

- Complete your journal assignment on Canvas by the end of Monday.

---

## Why statistics

- An essential aid to “signal detection”

- A universal language for communicating what we find.

- Required for competent evaluation of others’ work.

class: inverse
## Goal of today

Advanced skill in quantitative methods carries with it the responsibility to use those skills carefully and ethically.

Today, we'll discuss methodological issues present in statistics. 
- It can be tempting to use statistics to fix poor research design.
- These issues cannot be fixed quantitatively (even when it looks like they can).

- After today, we focus on what happens after you collect data. But it is still your job to study research design, data collection, and theoretical logic. 


---

## Constructs

- Our basic goal in science is to make inferences about the causal relations between constructs.
	
![](images/intro_construct.jpg)

---

We can’t do that directly, so we rely on proxies for those constructs.

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

In order to infer that A --&gt; B, we have to make three assumptions:
 - X is a good proxy for A
 - Y is a good proxy for B
 - X and Y are causally related
 
---

class: middle 

- When the first two assumptions are true, the relation between X and Y will provide a good estimate of the relation between A and B.

- What threatens our ability to carry out this seemingly simple task? 
    - How do quantitative methods help us solve these problems?

---

## Validity

Four kinds of validity in research threaten our ability to make valid causal inferences.  Solving each problem either directly requires quantitative methods or makes use of principles that are central to quantitative methods.


- Construct validity

- Statistical conclusion validity

- Internal validity

- External validity

---

## Construct validity

- The validity of the inference that a given operationalization of units, treatments, observations, or settings represents well the construct of which it is assumed to be an instance.

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

---

## Construct validity

![](images/cronbach.png)

Note: Terminology used by C&amp;M doesn't match what's used more recently. (predictive, concurrent, content, construct)

---

Consider the SAT (Quant section only). What construct(s) does this measure?

???

Make list on the board. Should include things like
* math ability
* effort (studying)
* access to test prep
* quality of schooling
* number of times taken

Might also include
* (English) verbal ability (word items)
* ability to sit still


---

## Construct validity

A primary component of construct validity is the "criterion." What is a criterion, and what critiques do the authors offer of criterion?

???

* What if criterions are bad?
* What if criterions have a lot of error?
* There's often ambiguity of which measure is the criterion.
* No single criterion is sufficient.

---

What were some of the additional methods described by Cronbach &amp; Meehl?

--

* group differences 
* correlation matrices and factor analysis 
* studies of internal structure (reliability)
* studies of change over occasion 
* studies of process

???

* Don't want groups to be synonymous with measure
* If correlations unexpected, not sure which measure (or both) is at fault
* High internal consistency can lower validity!
* test-retest good (if we don't expect change); better to show change after intervening experience
* observe process but how?

---

### Nomological net(work)

What is this?

--

* Interlocking system of "laws" which constitute a theory. 
* Or, specifying which other constructs and properties relate to our construct and how

* We have to be able to observe at least some of the network


---

&gt; When observations will not fit into the network as it stands, the scientist has a certain freedom in selecting where to modify the network (Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1953, p. 12).

There is no correct way to build a nomological network. (There are many incorrect ways....)
- There may be many equally good, but different ways to build the NN of a single construct. 
- Often lack of evidence
- Your job will frequently be to pick a single model, with no evidence, and justify it. 
- Finding places where a nomological network can be improved is a way to move a research program forward. 

---

See the list on page 22 of C&amp;M (1955) -- this contains the most important points in the article, ending with:

&gt; "The investigation of a test's construct validity is not essentially different from the general scientific procedures for developing and confirming theories" (p 22).

---

### Threats to construct validity

- inadequate explication of constructs

- construct confounding

- confounding constructs with levels of constructs

- reactive self-report changes

- reactivity to the experimental situation

- experimenter expectancy

- novelty and disruption effects

---

## Statistical conclusion validity

- **Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are related

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

- most basic: correlation coefficient (
`\(r_{xy}\)`
)
    - even more advanced methods index covariation in some way

---

### (Some) threats to statistical conclusion validity

- **low statistical power**

- violations of assumptions of statistical tests

- fishing and the error rate problem

- unreliable measures

- restricted range

- unreliable treatment implementation

- extraneous variance in the experimental setting

- heterogeneity of units



&lt;!-- ### Low statistical power --&gt;

&lt;!-- The problem of statistical power is easily understood with a simple two-group problem: --&gt;


&lt;!-- .pull-left[ --&gt;

&lt;!-- |Group 1 | Group 2 | --&gt;
&lt;!-- |:------:|:-------:| --&gt;
&lt;!-- | `\(M_1\)`  | `\(M_2\)`   | --&gt;
&lt;!-- | `\(SD_1\)` | `\(SD_2\)`  | --&gt;


&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- .pull-right[ --&gt;

&lt;!-- `$$t = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}}$$` --&gt;


&lt;!-- ] --&gt;
&lt;!-- .center[ --&gt;

&lt;!-- ] --&gt;



&lt;!-- **Quantitative ways to increase power:** --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Use matching, stratifying or blocking --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Measure and correct for covariates --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Correct for unreliable measurement --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Use within-participants designs --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Ensure that powerful statistical tests are used and their assumptions are met. --&gt;


&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;

&lt;!-- The formula for the t-test makes clear that power is increased by increasing effect strength (numerator) or decreasing error (denominator).  --&gt;

&lt;!-- The most obvious way to accomplish the latter is --&gt;
&lt;!-- by increasing sample size.  But other tactics are possible, many of them statistical. --&gt;

---

## Internal validity

- **Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are causally related.

  - Given that X and Y are correlated, can we validly infer that the relation is causal?

--

- Traditional view: direction, correlation, confounds
  - John Stuart Mill (1843)

--

- Counter-factual view
   - Effect is what did happen compared to what would have happened to the same people had they not had the treatment at the same time.
   - Major research design tools: manipulation, control, random assignment, replication, logic, common sense.

    
???

direction = Cause precedes effect

correlation = Cause covaries with effect

confounds = Other explanations are ruled less plausible

.pull-right[

Temporal precedence can be established in an experiment because treatment precedes outcome. 

But, when treatment is not possible, then logic and common sense can sometimes dictate temporal precedence.

Even if random assignment is used, participants may drop out of the study, producing unequal groups, a situation that has the same inferential problems as selection.

How could the design be modified and statistics used to help rule out selection and attrition confounds?

.pull-right[

.small[History refers to any event that occurs between the beginning of treatment and the measurement of outcome that might have produced the observed effect.

- A marketing campaign intended to increase beer sales happens to coincide with other events that might have the same effect: a particularly hot period of weather, a long losing streak by the Detroit Tigers, or the Republican National Convention.  How would these threats be eliminated?]

Maturation refers to changes in the organism that occur regardless of treatment and that may masquerade as a treatment effect.

- A school-wide educational intervention is predicted to increase achievement test scores.  The entire school must get the same curriculum, so a control group in the school is not possible.  How can the threat be reduced?

Testing refers to the possible change that may occur just because participants have been previously measured. These are often called practice or fatigue effects.

- Students do better on the first half of test compared to the second.
- Students do better in the second half of the term compared to the first. 

Without adding a control group, how might this threat be reduced?

]

.pull-right[

Change may occur because the measurement changes over time, perhaps becoming more or less reliable. 

Instrumentation reflects changes in the measurement; testing reflects changes in the object of measurement.

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." (Goodhart)

class: middle

The key point with internal validity is that something else besides the treatment is a plausible alternative explanation for any apparent treatment effect. 

Solving threats to internal validity is a research design problem, not a statistics problem.  Nonetheless, quantitative methods play a key role in making the case for internal validity.

---

### Removing the influence of other variables

If the "other variables" can be measured, their influence can be statistically controlled so that the hypothesized relation can be detected more accurately.

However:

**Statistical control should best be thought of as a method of last resort, to be used when design controls are not available or have failed.**


---

## External validity 

- **Definition:** The validity of the inference that a causal relation between operations generalizes to other units, treatments, observations, or settings.

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)
---
### Threats to external validity

- interaction of the causal relation with units

- interaction of the causal relation with treatment variations

- interaction of the causal relation with observations

- interaction of the causal relation with settings

- context-dependent mediation

Quantitative methods provide a powerful way to demonstrate moderation (interactions) and mediation effects.

---

## Measurement and statistics

The characteristics of measures (like reliability) are defined quantitatively.


.pull-left[
`$$r_{KK} = \frac{K\bar{r_{ij}}}{1 + (K-1)\bar{r_{ij}}}$$`

Formula for coefficient 
`\(\alpha\)`
where 
`\(K\)` 
is the number of items and 
`\(\bar{r_{ij}}\)`
is the average correlation between any two items on the test.

*By the way, 
`\(\alpha\)`
is a poor measure of reliability.
]


.pull-right[
`$$E(r_{xy}) = \rho_{xy}\sqrt{r_{xx}r_{yy}}$$`

Formula for the expected sample correlation between constructs 
`\(X\)` 
and 
`\(Y\)`
given internal consistencies
`\(r_{xx}\)` 
and 
`\(r_{yy}\)`.
